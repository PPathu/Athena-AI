  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to create  85.65 of the statutes; relating to:  ratification of the Driver 
License Compact.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill enters Wisconsin into the Driver License Compact, which establishes 
standards for the treatment and exchange of driver licensing and conviction 
information and other data pertinent to the licensing process.
The DLC requires all participating states to recognize certain kinds of 
violations relating mostly to operating motor vehicles and the administrative 
actions taken in response to those violations, such as suspension or revocation of a 
person[s operating privilege by the appropriate state agency (DLC code violations). 
Under the DLC, when a person who is licensed in one state that is a party to the 
DLC commits a DLC code violation in another party state, the licensing state takes 
administrative action in response to the violation, based on information provided by 
the state in which the violation occurred. Any administrative action by a party state 
is recognized by all other party states. The DLC also generally provides that records 
concerning a licensed driver are maintained only by the licensing state.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.1
