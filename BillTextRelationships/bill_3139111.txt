Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, a prosecutor may dismiss or amend a criminal charge 
without approval from the court.  Under this bill, a prosecutor must get the court [s 
approval to dismiss or amend a charge if the charge is for any of the following:  1) a 
crime of domestic abuse or a violation of a domestic violence temporary restraining 
order or injunction; 2) theft of an automobile; 3) a crime of abuse of an individual at 
risk or a violation of an individual-at-risk TRO or injunction; 4) first-degree, 
second-degree, or third-degree sexual assault; 5) a crime against a child; 6) illegal 
possession of a firearm if the person has been convicted of, adjudicated delinquent 
for, or found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect of, committing, 
soliciting, conspiring, or attempting to commit a violent felony, as defined under 
current law; or 7) reckless driving that results in great bodily harm.  The court may 
approve the dismissal or amendment of such a charge only if the court finds the 1

SECTION  1
action is consistent with the public [s interest in deterring the commission of these 
crimes and with the legislature [s intent, expressed in this bill, to vigorously 
prosecute individuals who commit these crimes.  If the court approves any 
dismissal or amendment in a year, the court must submit an annual report to the 
legislature detailing each approval.
Current law allows a prosecutor to enter into a deferred prosecution 
agreement with a defendant who is charged or may be charged with a crime.  
Generally, under a deferred prosecution agreement, the prosecutor agrees to 
dismiss a charge or not file a charge if the defendant complies with specified 
conditions.  In addition, current law provides specific criteria for a deferred 
prosecution agreement if the defendant is or may be charged with child sexual 
abuse if the defendant is the parent of, the guardian of, a close relative of, or 
residing with the child; with a crime of domestic violence; or with a violation of a 
domestic violence TRO or injunction.  Current law also prohibits a prosecutor from 
entering into a deferred prosecution agreement with a defendant who is charged or 
may be charged with operating a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant 
or a controlled substance, causing injury to another while operating a vehicle while 
under the influence, or homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle.  The bill prohibits a 
prosecutor from entering into a deferred prosecution agreement with a defendant if 
a complaint or information is filed that alleges the person committed any of the 
same crimes listed in items 1 to 7 above.
