Representatives MAXEY , ARMSTRONG , ALLEN , BEHNKE , GUNDRUM , KNODL , 
KREIBICH , MURPHY , PRONSCHINSKE , WICHGERS  and TUSLER . Referred to

AN ACT to amend  48.41 (1), 48.42 (2) (a), 48.46 (2), 48.837 (5) and 48.91 (3); to 
create  48.41 (2) (bm) and 48.913 (1) (em) of the statutes; relating to:  a 
disclaimer of parental rights and payments allowed in connection with an 
adoption.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill provides a method by which a mother, father, or alleged or presumed 
father may disclaim his or her parental rights with respect to a child under the age 
of one who is not an Indian child in writing as an alternative to appearing in court 
to consent to the termination of his or her parental rights.  The bill also allows 
payments to be made to a licensed out-of-state private child placing agency for 
services provided in connection with an adoption.
Disclaimer of parental rights
Subject to certain exceptions, current law generally requires a birth parent to 
appear in court to consent to the termination of his or her parental rights.  This bill 
adds an exception that allows a mother, father, or alleged or presumed father to 
avoid appearing in court if he or she files with the court an affidavit disclaiming his 
or her parental rights with respect to a child under the age of one and if no 
participant in the court proceeding knows or has reason to know that the child is an 
Indian child.  A minor may use such an affidavit of disclaimer only after the TPR 1

SENATE BILL 79- 2 - LRB-0053/1
EHS:cdc
petition has been filed, he or she has been offered legal counseling, and he or she 
has been appointed a guardian ad litem and only if the guardian ad litem approves 
the disclaimer.  The affidavit must comply with certain requirements, including 
that it must be witnessed and notarized and must include a statement that the 
parent understands the effect of an order to terminate parental rights and that he 
or she voluntarily disclaims any rights that he or she may have to the child.  The bill 
requires the court to review the affidavit and make findings on whether it meets all 
of the requirements.
Under the bill, the affidavit containing a disclaimer of parental rights may be 
executed before the birth of the child by the father or alleged or presumed father but 
not the mother and may be executed by either parent 120 hours or more after the 
birth until the child [s first birthday; however, the affidavit may not be executed by 
either parent from birth until 120 hours after the birth or on or after the child [s 
first birthday.
Under the bill, if executed by the father or alleged or presumed father before 
the child [s birth, the disclaimer is revokable for any reason until 72 hours after 
execution or 120 hours after the birth, whichever is later.  If executed by the mother, 
the disclaimer is revocable for any reason until 72 hours after execution.  If not 
revoked by the applicable time limit, the disclaimer is irrevocable unless obtained 
by fraud or duress.  Under the bill, no action to invalidate a disclaimer, including an 
action based on fraud or duress, may be commenced more than three months after 
the affidavit was executed.  If parental rights to a child are terminated based upon 
such a disclaimer of parental rights, the bill prohibits a court from entering an 
order granting adoption of the child until three months have passed since the 
affidavit was executed.
The bill requires the agency making the placement of the child for adoption, 
whether the agency is the Department of Children and Families, the county 
department of human services or social services, or a licensed child welfare agency, 
to offer both counseling and legal counseling to the person disclaiming his or her 
parental rights, at the agency [s expense, prior to execution of the affidavit.  The 
person must acknowledge in the affidavit that he or she has been offered these 
counseling and legal counseling sessions and whether or not he or she accepted 
them.
Payments relating to adoption
This bill allows payments to be made to an out-of-state private child placing 
agency that is licensed in the state in which it operates for services provided in 
connection with an adoption and, where applicable, in compliance with the federal 
Indian Child Welfare Act, as certified to DCF.  Under the bill, a private child placing 
agency means a private corporation, agency, foundation, institution, or charitable 
organization, or any private person or attorney, that facilitates, causes, or is 
involved in the placement of a child from one state to another state.  Current law 2025 - 2026  Legislature
