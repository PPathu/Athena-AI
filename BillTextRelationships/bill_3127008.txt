  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  40.22 (1), 40.22 (2m) (intro.), 40.22 (2r) (intro.) and 40.22 (3) 
(intro.); to create  40.26 (7) of the statutes; relating to:  law enforcement and 
firefighter annuitants in the Wisconsin Retirement System who are rehired by 
a participating employer.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, certain persons who receive a retirement or disability 
annuity from the Wisconsin Retirement System and who are hired by an employer 
that participates in the WRS must suspend that annuity and may not receive a 
WRS annuity payment until the employee is no longer in a WRS-covered position.  
This suspension applies to a person who 1) has reached his or her normal 
retirement date; 2) is appointed to a position with a WRS-participating employer or 
provides employee services to a WRS-participating employer; and 3) is expected to 
work at least two-thirds of what is considered full-time employment by the 
Department of Employee Trust Funds.
This bill creates an exception to this suspension for an annuitant who retired 
from employment with a participating employer and who is subsequently rehired or 
provides employee services after retirement if 1) the annuitant is a retired law 
enforcement officer or firefighter; 2) at the time the annuitant initially retires from 
covered employment with a participating employer, the annuitant does not have an 1

agreement with any participating employer to return to employment; and 3) the 
annuitant elects to not become a participating employee at the time the annuitant 
is rehired or enters into a contract after retirement.  In other words, the bill allows 
an annuitant who was a law enforcement officer or firefighter to return to work 
with an employer that participates in the WRS and elect to not become a 
participating employee for purposes of the WRS but instead continue to receive an 
annuity from the WRS.
For further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
