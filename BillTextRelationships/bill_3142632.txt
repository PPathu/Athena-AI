Revenue.
AN ACT to create  71.05 (6) (b) 57. of the statutes; relating to:  an income tax 
subtraction for certain expenses paid by a school teacher.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Currently, an elementary or secondary school teacher may claim a deduction 
on the individual [s federal income tax return for certain eligible expenses paid by 
the individual during the taxable year, not exceeding $300.  Eligible expenses 
include amounts paid to participate in professional development courses and 
amounts paid for books and other classroom supplies.
This bill allows an elementary or secondary school teacher to claim a similar 
deduction for state income tax purposes for eligible expenses, not exceeding $300, 
paid by the teacher during the taxable year.  The eligible expenses are the same as 
those described under federal law.  Finally, the taxpayer may claim the deduction 
for state income tax purposes regardless of whether the taxpayer claims the 
deduction for federal income tax purposes.
Because this bill relates to an exemption from state or local taxes, it may be 
referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Tax Exemptions for a report to be 
printed as an appendix to the bill.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.1
