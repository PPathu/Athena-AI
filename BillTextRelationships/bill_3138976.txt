Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Elimination of cost sharing for prescription drugs under the Medical 
Assistance program
Under current law, certain persons who receive health services under the 
Medical Assistance program, also known in this state as BadgerCare, are required 
to contribute a cost-sharing payment to the cost of certain health services.  This bill 
eliminates all cost-sharing payments for prescription drugs under the Medical 1

Assistance program.  The Medical Assistance program is a joint state and federal 
program that provides health services to individuals who have limited financial 
resources.
Cost-sharing cap on insulin
The bill prohibits every health insurance policy and governmental self-insured 
health plan that covers insulin and imposes cost sharing on prescription drugs from 
imposing cost sharing on insulin in an amount that exceeds $35 for a one-month 
supply.  Current law requires every health insurance policy that provides coverage 
of expenses incurred for treatment of diabetes to provide coverage for specified 
expenses and items, including insulin.  The required coverage under current law for 
certain diabetes treatments other than insulin infusion pumps is subject to the 
same exclusions, limitations, deductibles, and coinsurance provisions of the policy 
as other covered expenses.  The bill [s cost-sharing limitation on insulin supersedes 
the specification that the exclusions, limitations, deductibles, and coinsurance are 
the same as for other coverage.
Fiduciary and disclosure requirements for pharmacy benefit managers
The bill imposes fiduciary and disclosure requirements on pharmacy benefit 
managers.  Pharmacy benefit managers contract with health plans that provide 
prescription drug benefits to administer those benefits for the plans.  They also 
have contracts with pharmacies and pay the pharmacies for providing drugs to the 
plan beneficiaries.
The bill provides that a pharmacy benefit manager owes a fiduciary duty to a 
health plan sponsor.  The bill also requires that a pharmacy benefit manager 
annually disclose all of the following information to the plan sponsor:
1.  The indirect profit received by the pharmacy benefit manager from owning 
a pharmacy or service provider.
2.  Any payments made to a consultant or broker who works on behalf of the 
plan sponsor.
3.  From the amounts received from drug manufacturers, the amounts 
retained by the pharmacy benefit manager that are related to the plan sponsor [s 
claims or bona fide service fees.
4.  The amounts received from network pharmacies and the amount retained 
by the pharmacy benefit manager.
Reimbursements for certain 340B program entities
The bill prohibits any person from reimbursing certain entities that 
participate in the federal drug pricing program, known as the 340B program, for a 
drug subject to an agreement under the program at a rate lower than that paid for 
the same drug to pharmacies that have a similar prescription volume.  The bill also 
prohibits a person from imposing any fee, charge back, or other adjustment on the 
basis of the entity [s participation in the 340B program.  The entities covered by the 
prohibitions under the bill are federally qualified health centers, critical access 
hospitals, and grantees under the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, as well 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 62- 3 - LRB-1302/1
JPC:all
as these entities [ pharmacies and any pharmacy with which any of the entities have 
contracted to dispense drugs through the 340B program.
Drug repository program
Under current law, the Department of Health Services must maintain a drug 
repository program under which any person may donate certain drugs or supplies 
to be dispensed to and used by eligible individuals, prioritizing uninsured and 
indigent individuals.  The bill allows DHS to partner with out-of-state drug 
repository programs.  The bill also allows out-of-state persons to donate to the drug 
repository program in Wisconsin and persons in Wisconsin to donate to 
participating drug repository programs in other states.  Further, the bill directs 
DHS to study and implement a centralized, physical drug repository program.
Value-based diabetes medication pilot project
The bill directs the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance to develop a pilot 
project under which a pharmacy benefit manager and pharmaceutical 
manufacturer are directed to create a value-based, sole-source arrangement to 
reduce the costs of prescription diabetes medication.  The bill allows OCI to 
promulgate rules to implement the pilot project.
Pharmacist continuing education credits for volunteering at free and 
charitable clinics
Under current law, a licensed pharmacist must renew his or her license every 
two years.  An applicant for renewal of a pharmacist license must submit proof that 
he or she has completed 30 hours of continuing education within the two-year 
period immediately preceding the date of his or her application.  The bill allows 
pharmacists to meet up to 10 hours of the continuing education requirement for 
each two-year period by volunteering at a free and charitable clinic approved by the 
Pharmacy Examining Board.
Prescription drug importation program
The bill requires the commissioner of insurance, in consultation with persons 
interested in the sale and pricing of prescription drugs and federal officials and 
agencies, to design and implement a prescription drug importation program for the 
benefit of and that generates savings for Wisconsin residents.  The bill establishes 
requirements for the program, including all of the following:
1.  The commissioner must designate a state agency to become a licensed 
wholesale distributor or contract with a licensed wholesale distributor and to seek 
federal certification and approval to import prescription drugs.
2.  The program must comply with certain federal regulations and import from 
Canadian suppliers only prescription drugs that are not brand-name drugs, have 
fewer than four competitor drugs in this country, and for which importation creates 
substantial savings.
3.  The commissioner must ensure that prescription drugs imported under the 
program are not distributed, dispensed, or sold outside of Wisconsin.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 62- 4 - LRB-1302/1
JPC:all
4.  The program must have an audit procedure to ensure the program complies 
with certain requirements specified in the bill.
Before submitting the proposed program to the federal government for 
certification, the commissioner must submit the proposed program to the Joint 
Committee on Finance for its approval.
Pharmacy benefits tool grants
The bill directs OCI to award grants in an amount of up to $500,000 in each 
fiscal year to health care providers to develop and implement a patient pharmacy 
benefits tool that would allow prescribers to disclose the cost of prescription drugs 
for patients.  The tool must be usable by physicians and other prescribers to 
determine the cost of prescription drugs for their patients.  Any health care 
provider that receives a grant to develop and implement a patient pharmacy 
benefits tool is required to contribute matching funds equal to at least 50 percent of 
the total grant awarded.
Prescription drug purchasing entity study
The bill requires OCI to conduct a study on the viability of creating or 
implementing a state prescription drug purchasing entity.
Licensure of pharmacy services administrative organizations
The bill requires that a pharmacy services administrative organization 
(PSAO) be licensed by OCI.  Under the bill, a PSAO is an entity operating in 
Wisconsin that does all of the following:
1.  Contracts with an independent pharmacy to conduct business on the 
pharmacy [s behalf with a third-party payer.
2.  Provides at least one administrative service to an independent pharmacy 
and negotiates and enters into a contract with a third-party payer or pharmacy 
benefit manager on the pharmacy [s behalf.
The bill defines Xindependent pharmacy Y to mean a licensed pharmacy 
operating in Wisconsin that is under common ownership with no more than two 
other pharmacies.  XAdministrative service Y is defined to mean assisting with 
claims or audits, providing centralized payment, performing certification in a 
specialized care program, providing compliance support, setting flat fees for generic 
drugs, assisting with store layout, managing inventory, providing marketing 
support, providing management and analysis of payment and drug dispensing data, 
or providing resources for retail cash cards.  The bill defines Xthird-party payer Y to 
mean an entity operating in Wisconsin that pays or insures health, medical, or 
prescription drug expenses on behalf of beneficiaries.  The bill uses the current law 
definition of Xpharmacy benefit manager, Y which is an entity doing business in 
Wisconsin that contracts to administer or manage prescription drug benefits on 
behalf of an insurer or other entity that provides prescription drug benefits to 
Wisconsin residents.
To obtain the license required by the bill, a person must apply to OCI and 
provide the contact information for the applicant and a contact person, evidence of 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 62- 5 - LRB-1302/1
JPC:all
financial responsibility of at least $1,000,000, and any other information required 
by the commissioner by rule.  Under the bill, the license fee is set by the 
commissioner, and the term of a license is two years.
The bill also requires that a PSAO disclose to OCI the extent of any ownership 
or control by an entity that provides pharmacy services; provides prescription drug 
or device services; or manufactures, sells, or distributes prescription drugs, 
biologicals, or medical devices.  The PSAO must notify OCI within five days of any 
material change in its ownership or control related to such an entity.
Licensure of pharmaceutical representatives
The bill requires a pharmaceutical representative to be licensed by OCI and to 
display the pharmaceutical representative [s license during each visit with a health 
care professional.  The bill defines Xpharmaceutical representative Y to mean an 
individual who markets or promotes pharmaceuticals to health care professionals 
on behalf of a pharmaceutical manufacturer for compensation.
The term of a license issued under the bill is one year, and the license is 
renewable.  The application to obtain or renew a license must include the 
applicant [s contact information, a description of the type of work in which the 
applicant will engage, the license fee, an attestation that professional education 
requirements are met, proof that any penalties and other fees are paid, and any 
other information required by OCI by rule.  Under the bill, the license fee is set by 
the commissioner.  The bill requires the pharmaceutical representative to report, 
within four business days, any change to the information provided on the 
application or any material change to the pharmaceutical representative [s business 
operations or other information required to be reported under the bill.
The bill requires that a pharmaceutical representative complete a professional 
education course prior to becoming licensed and to annually complete at least five 
hours of continuing professional education courses.  The coursework must include, 
at a minimum, training in ethical standards, whistleblower protections, and the 
laws and rules applicable to pharmaceutical marketing.  The bill directs the 
commissioner to regularly publish a list of courses that fulfill the education 
requirements.  Under the bill, a course provider must disclose any conflict of 
interest to the commissioner, and the courses may not be provided by the employer 
of a pharmaceutical representative or be funded by the pharmaceutical industry or 
a third party funded by the industry.
The bill requires that, no later than June 1 of each year, a pharmaceutical 
representative report to OCI the pharmaceutical representative [s total number of 
contacts with health care professionals in Wisconsin, the specialties of those health 
care professionals, the location and duration of each contact, the pharmaceuticals 
discussed, and the value of any item provided to a health care professional.  The bill 
directs the commissioner to publish the information on OCI [s website without 
identifying individual health care professionals.
The bill requires that a pharmaceutical representative, during each contact 
with a health care professional, disclose the wholesale acquisition cost of any 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 62- 6 - LRB-1302/1
JPC:all
pharmaceuticals discussed and the names of at least three generic prescription 
drugs from the same therapeutic class.
The bill directs the commissioner to promulgate ethical standards for 
pharmaceutical representatives.  Additionally, the bill prohibits a pharmaceutical 
representative from engaging in deceptive or misleading marketing of a 
pharmaceutical product; using a title or designation that could reasonably lead a 
licensed health care professional, or an employee or representative of such a 
professional, to believe that the pharmaceutical representative is licensed to 
practice in a health occupation unless the pharmaceutical representative holds a 
license to practice in that health occupation; or attending a patient examination 
without the patient [s consent.
An individual who violates any of the requirements under the bill is subject to 
a forfeiture, and the individual [s license may be suspended or revoked.  An 
individual whose license is revoked must wait at least two years before applying for 
a new license.
Insulin safety net programs
The bill requires insulin manufacturers to establish a program under which 
qualifying Wisconsin residents who are in urgent need of insulin and are uninsured 
or have limited insurance coverage can be dispensed insulin at a pharmacy.  An 
individual is in urgent need of insulin if the individual needs insulin in order to 
avoid the likelihood of suffering a significant health consequence and possesses less 
than a seven-day supply of insulin readily available for use.  Under the program, if 
a qualifying individual in urgent need of insulin provides a pharmacy with a form 
attesting that the individual meets the program [s eligibility requirements, specified 
proof of residency, and a valid insulin prescription, the pharmacy must dispense a 
30-day supply of insulin to the individual and may charge the individual a 
copayment of no more than $35.  The pharmacy may submit an electronic payment 
claim for the insulin [s acquisition cost to the manufacturer or agree to receive a 
replacement of the same insulin in the amount dispensed.
The bill also requires that each insulin manufacturer establish a patient 
assistance program to make insulin available to any qualifying Wisconsin resident 
who, among other requirements, is uninsured or has limited insurance coverage 
and whose family income does not exceed 400 percent of the federal poverty line.  
Under the bill, an individual must apply to participate in a manufacturer [s 
program.  If the manufacturer determines that the individual meets the program [s 
eligibility requirements, the manufacturer must issue the individual a statement of 
eligibility, which is valid for 12 months and may be renewed.  Under the bill, if an 
individual with a statement of eligibility and valid insulin prescription requests 
insulin from a pharmacy, the pharmacy must submit an order to the manufacturer, 
who must then provide a 90-day supply of insulin at no charge to the individual or 
pharmacy.  The pharmacy may charge the individual a copayment of no more than 
$50.  Under the bill, a manufacturer is not required to issue a statement of 
eligibility if the individual has prescription drug coverage through an individual or 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 62- 7 - LRB-1302/1
JPC:all
group health plan and the manufacturer determines that the individual [s insulin 
needs are better addressed through the manufacturer [s copayment assistance 
program.  In such case, the manufacturer must provide the individual with 
necessary drug coupons to submit to a pharmacy, and the individual may not be 
required to pay more than a $50 copayment for a 90-day supply of insulin.
Under the bill, if the manufacturer determines that an individual is not 
eligible for the patient assistance program, the individual may file an appeal with 
OCI.  The bill directs OCI to establish procedures for deciding appeals.  Under the 
bill, OCI must issue a decision within 10 days, and that decision is final.
The bill requires that insulin manufacturers annually report to OCI certain 
information, including the number of individuals served and the cost of insulin 
dispensed under the programs and that OCI annually report to the governor and 
the legislature on the programs.  The bill also directs OCI to conduct public 
outreach and develop an information sheet about the programs, conduct 
satisfaction surveys of individuals and pharmacies that participate in the 
programs, and report to the governor and the legislature on the surveys by July 1, 
2028.  Additionally, the bill requires that OCI develop a training program for health 
care navigators to assist individuals in accessing appropriate long-term insulin 
options and maintain a list of trained navigators.
The bill provides that a manufacturer that fails to comply with the bill [s 
provisions may be assessed a forfeiture of up to $200,000 per month of 
noncompliance, which increases to $400,000 per month if the manufacturer 
continues to be in noncompliance after six months and to $600,000 per month if the 
manufacturer continues to be in noncompliance after one year.  The bill [s 
requirements do not apply to manufacturers with annual insulin sales revenue in 
Wisconsin of no more than $2,000,000 or to insulin that costs less than a specified 
dollar amount.
Prescription Drug Affordability Review Board
The bill creates a Prescription Drug Affordability Review Board, whose 
purpose is to protect Wisconsin residents and other stakeholders from the high 
costs of prescription drugs.  The board consists of the commissioner of insurance 
and the following members, all of whom are appointed by the governor for four-year 
terms:
1.  Two members who represent the pharmaceutical drug industry, at least 
one of whom is a licensed pharmacist.
2.  Two members who represent the health insurance industry.
3.  Two members who represent the health care industry, at least one of whom 
is a licensed practitioner.
4.  Two members who represent the interests of the public.
The bill requires the board to meet in open session at least four times per year 
to review prescription drug pricing information.  The board must provide at least 
two weeks [ public notice of each meeting, make the meeting [s materials publicly 
available at least one week prior to the meeting, and provide the opportunity for 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 62- 8 - LRB-1302/1
JPC:all
public comment.  The bill imposes conflict of interest requirements for the board 
relating to recusal and public disclosure of certain conflicts.  The bill directs the 
board to access and assess drug pricing information, to the extent practicable, by 
accessing and assessing information from other states, by assessing spending for 
the drug in Wisconsin, and by accessing other available pricing information.
Under the bill, the board must conduct drug cost affordability reviews.  The 
board must identify prescription drugs whose launch wholesale acquisition cost 
exceeds specified thresholds, prescription drugs whose increase in wholesale 
acquisition cost exceeds specified thresholds, and other prescription drugs that may 
create affordability challenges for the health care system in Wisconsin.  For each 
identified prescription drug, the board must determine whether to conduct an 
affordability review by seeking stakeholder input and considering the average 
patient cost share for the drug.  During an affordability review, the board must 
determine whether use of the prescription drug that is fully consistent with the 
labeling approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration or standard 
medical practice has led or will lead to an affordability challenge for the health care 
system in Wisconsin.  In making this determination, the bill requires the board to 
consider a variety of factors, which include the following:
1.  The drug [s wholesale acquisition cost.
2.  The average monetary price concession, discount, or rebate the 
manufacturer provides, or is expected to provide, for the drug to health plans.
3.  The total amount of price concessions, discounts, and rebates the 
manufacturer provides to each pharmacy benefit manager for the drug.
4.  The price at which therapeutic alternatives have been sold and the average 
monetary concession, discount, or rebate the manufacturer provides, or is expected 
to provide, to health plan payors and pharmacy benefit managers for therapeutic 
alternatives.
5.  The costs to health plans based on patient access consistent with federal 
labeled indications and recognized standard medical practice.
6.  The impact on patient access resulting from the drug [s cost relative to 
insurance benefit design.
7.  The current or expected dollar value of drug-specific patient access 
programs that are supported by the manufacturer.
8.  The relative financial impacts to health, medical, or social services costs 
that can be quantified and compared to baseline effects of existing therapeutic 
alternatives.
9.  The average patient copay or other cost sharing for the drug.
If the board determines that a prescription drug will lead to an affordability 
challenge, the bill directs the board to establish an upper payment limit for that 
drug that applies to all purchases and payor reimbursements of the drug dispensed 
or administered to individuals in Wisconsin.  In establishing the upper payment 
limit, the board must consider the cost of administering the drug, the cost of 
delivering it to consumers, and other relevant administrative costs.  For certain 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 62- 9 - LRB-1302/1
JPC:all
SECTION  1
drugs, the board must solicit information from the manufacturer regarding the 
price increase and, if the board determines that the price increase is not a result of 
the need for increased manufacturing capacity or other effort to improve patient 
access during a public health emergency, the board must establish an upper 
payment limit equal to the drug [s cost prior to the price increase.
Further, this bill provides $500,000 in program revenue in fiscal year 2026 ]27 
for onetime implementation costs associated with establishing an Office of 
Prescription Drug Affordability in OCI.  The bill provides that the Office of 
Prescription Drug Affordability is responsible for prescription drug affordability 
programming within OCI and for overseeing the operations of the Prescription 
Drug Affordability Review Board.  Additionally, the bill authorizes and funds for 
fiscal year 2026 ]27 16.0 positions for the Office of Prescription Drug Affordability.
Finally, the bill credits to the appropriation account for OCI [s general program 
operations all moneys received from the regulation of pharmacy benefit managers, 
pharmacy benefit management brokers, pharmacy benefit management 
consultants, pharmacy services administrative organizations, and pharmaceutical 
sales representatives.
This proposal may contain a health insurance mandate requiring a social and 
financial impact report under s. 601.423, stats.
