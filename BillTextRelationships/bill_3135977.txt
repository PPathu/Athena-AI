of the statutes; relating to:  financing the operating costs and certain out-of-
state projects of nonprofit institutions and compensation of employees of the 
Wisconsin Health and Educational Facilities Authority.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill makes the following changes to laws governing the Wisconsin Health 
and Educational Facilities Authority, which is a public body corporate and politic 
created outside of official state government:
1.  Under current law, WHEFA may issue bonds to finance certain projects of 
health, educational, research, and other nonprofit institutions.  The bill authorizes 
WHEFA to issue bonds for the purpose of financing working capital of such 
institutions to cover operating costs.
2.  Current law authorizes WHEFA to help finance the costs of projects located 
outside of Wisconsin provided that the project includes a substantial component 
located within the state.  The bill instead authorizes the financing of a project 
outside the state if the owner or operator of the project, or an affiliate of the owner 
or operator, has a presence within the state.
3.  Under current law, WHEFA appoints an executive director to administer 
the authority.  The executive director [s compensation may not exceed the maximum 1

of the salary range established for state government positions assigned to executive 
salary group six.  This bill increases that maximum assignment to executive salary 
group eight.
4.  Similarly, current law provides that all other WHEFA employees may not 
receive compensation that exceeds the maximum of the salary range established for 
state government positions assigned to executive salary group three.  This bill 
increases that maximum assignment to executive salary group five.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
