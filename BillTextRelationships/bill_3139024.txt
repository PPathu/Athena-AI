  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to create  chapter 798 of the statutes; relating to:  statutory recognition 
of specialized treatment court and commercial court dockets.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill statutorily recognizes specialized dockets for treatment courts and for 
commercial cases.  The bill recognizes in statute treatment courts, which are 
defined in the bill to include adult drug treatment court, juvenile drug treatment 
court, operating while intoxicated treatment court, mental health treatment court, 
family dependency treatment court, veterans treatment court, hybrid treatment 
court, and tribal healing to wellness court.
The bill also statutorily recognizes a specialized docket for commercial cases.  
Under the bill, the chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, taking into 
consideration recommendations from the relevant chief judges of the judicial 
administrative districts, must select circuit court judges who will be assigned to the 
commercial court docket upon each judge [s agreement to serve.  The bill provides 
that a judge who presides over cases on the commercial court docket is not 
prohibited from working on any other assigned docket.
Under the bill, certain commercial case types must be assigned to the 
commercial court docket, including cases involving all of the following:  1) the 
governance or internal affairs of business organizations; 2) tortious or statutorily 
prohibited business activity, unfair competition, or antitrust claims; 3) the sale, 
consolidation, or merger of a business organization or the conversion, share 1

exchange, or sale of substantially all of the assets of a business organization; 4) the 
issuance, sale, or transfer of securities; 5) intellectual property rights; 6) the 
relationship between a franchisor and franchisee or similar distribution 
relationship; 7) certain claims or disputes involving the Uniform Commercial Code, 
when the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000; 8) receiverships in excess of 
$250,000; 9) confirmation of arbitration awards and compelling or enforcing 
arbitration awards when the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000; and 10) real 
estate construction disputes when the amount in controversy exceeds $250,000.  
The bill provides that certain types of cases are ineligible for assignment to the 
commercial court docket, including small claims cases, cases involving a 
governmental entity or political subdivision seeking to enforce a statutory or 
regulatory restriction or prohibition, or disputes between landlords and tenants.
The commercial court docket created under the bill is a commercial case 
docket that generally involves disputes between commercial entities rather than 
individuals and does not include actions typically involving individuals such as 
personal injury suits, products liability, malpractice, or other tort claims or 
landlord and tenant disputes or similar claims.  Under the bill, parties may jointly 
move for discretionary assignment of a case to the commercial court docket if the 
case is one that is not identified under the mandatory criteria but is not otherwise 
ineligible for assignment.  The bill provides that a decision granting or denying a 
motion for a discretionary assignment of a case to the commercial court docket is 
final and nonappealable.
The bill also allows that parties to a case that is filed in a judicial 
administrative district that does not have a dedicated commercial court docket may, 
in certain circumstances, jointly petition for transfer of the case to a commercial 
court docket.  Under the bill, no party may withdraw a request for transfer to the 
commercial court docket after a judicial assignment of the case has been made.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
