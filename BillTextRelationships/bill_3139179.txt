Whereas, though originally a solemn Catholic holy day, Saint Patrick [s Day 
has evolved into a much more secular holiday celebrating Irish music, culture, and 
heritage; now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the assembly , That the members of the Wisconsin Assembly 
salute all of the persons of Irish descent for their significant contributions to this 
state, express appreciation for those persons who have kept alive Irish culture and 
traditions, and join with all Wisconsinites who revere their Irish heritage in 
celebrating Saint Patrick [s Day on March 17, 2025.
