Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill requires the state superintendent of public instruction to incorporate 
cursive writing into the model academic standards for English language arts.  The 
bill also requires all school boards, independent charter schools, and private schools 
participating in a parental choice program to include cursive writing in its 
respective curriculum for the elementary grades.  Specifically, each elementary 
school curriculum must include the objective that pupils be able to write legibly in 
cursive by the end of fifth grade.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.
