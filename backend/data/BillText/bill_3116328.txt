Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Current law provides that any person seeking an elective office who files 
nomination papers and qualifies to appear on the ballot may not decline 
nomination.  The person [s name must appear on the ballot except in the case of 
death.
Under this bill, a person who files nomination papers with the Elections 
Commission for an office to be filled at the general election nevertheless does not 
qualify to appear on the ballot at the partisan primary or general election, and the 
person[s name is prohibited from appearing on the ballot, if before the last day 
provided in current law for the Elections Commission to certify candidates [ names 
to the counties for the partisan primary or general election, the person files a sworn 
statement with the commission attesting that the person withdraws his or her 
candidacy.  Under current law, independent candidates for president and vice 
president and candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, the 
state senate and assembly, governor and lieutenant governor, secretary of state, 
state treasurer, and district attorney file such nomination papers with the 
commission.  The bill includes all of those offices except district attorney.  The bill 
also requires the Elections Commission to establish and implement a process by 1
