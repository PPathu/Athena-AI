  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to create  59.28 (3) and 79.039 (1g) of the statutes; relating to:  county 
sheriff assistance with certain federal immigration functions.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill requires sheriffs to request proof of legal presence status from 
individuals held in a county jail for an offense punishable as a felony.  The bill also 
requires sheriffs to comply with detainers and administrative warrants received 
from the federal department of homeland security regarding individuals held in the 
county jail for a criminal offense.
Under the bill, sheriffs must annually certify to the Department of Revenue 
that they have complied with each of these requirements.  If a sheriff fails to provide 
such a certification, DOR must  reduce the county [s shared revenue payments for 
the next year by 15 percent.  The bill also requires sheriffs to maintain a record of 
the number of individuals from whom proof of legal presence is requested who are 
verified as unlawfully present in this state and a list of the types of crimes for which 
those individuals were confined in the jail.  The information must be provided to the 
Department of Justice upon request, and DOJ must compile the information and 
submit a report to the legislature.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.1
