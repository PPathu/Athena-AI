to eligible applicant farmers for the purchase of seed treatment that is registered for 
use on corn seed to discourage sandhill cranes from consuming the seed.  Under the 
program, applicants may be reimbursed for up to 50 percent of the actual cost of the 
purchase of seed treatment, not to exceed $6,250 per farm, per year.
Value-added agricultural practices
The bill allows DATCP to provide education and technical assistance related 
to producing value-added agricultural products.  Under the bill, DATCP may 
provide education and assistance related to organic farming practices; collaborate 
with organic producers, industry participants, and local organizations that 
coordinate organic farming; and stimulate interest and investment in organic 
production.  The bill also allows DATCP to provide grants to organic producers, 
industry participants, and local organizations, which may be used to provide 
education and technical assistance related to organic farming, to help create 
organic farming plans, and to assist farmers in transitioning to organic farming.  
The bill also authorizes DATCP to provide grants to entities to provide education 
and training to farmers about best practices related to grazing.  DATCP is also 
authorized under the bill to help farmers market value-added agricultural 
products.
Meat processing tuition and curriculum development grants

education, and to improve farmers [ incomes and direct access to markets.  Under 
the bill, DATCP may provide grants to entities for these purposes.
Spending cap for the Wisconsin agricultural exports program
Under current law, the Center for International Agribusiness Marketing, 
operated by DATCP, promotes the export of Wisconsin agricultural and 
agribusiness products in foreign markets.  Current law provides that the center 
may not expend more than $1,000,000 in any fiscal year.
The bill eliminates the $1,000,000-per-year spending cap for the center.
Changes to the agricultural conservation easement purchase program
In the 2009-11 biennial budget act, the agricultural conservation easement 
purchase program was created for the purchase of agricultural conservation 
easements, from willing landowners, by DATCP in conjunction with political 
subdivisions and nonprofit conservation organizations. An agricultural 
conservation easement (easement) is an interest in land that preserves the land for 
agricultural use while the ownership of the land itself remains with the landowner.  
Under the program as it was created in the act, DATCP was required to solicit 
applications to the program at least once annually and was provided $12,000,000 in 
general fund supported borrowing for the purchase of the easements.  Since the 
program was first created, the requirement that DATCP solicit applications to the 
program at least once annually was repealed, DATCP [s authority for $12,000,000 in 
general fund supported borrowing for the purchase of the easements was repealed, 
and a new provision required DNR to provide to DATCP funds from the Warren 
Knowles-Gaylord Nelson stewardship program for the purchase of the easements.
The bill undoes those changes, reinstating DATCP [s requirement to solicit 
applications to the program at least once annually, providing DATCP authority for 
$15,000,000 in general fund supported borrowing for the purchase of easements, 
and removing the requirement that DNR provide DATCP funds from the Warren 
Knowles-Gaylord Nelson stewardship program for the purchase of the easements.
Commercial nitrogen optimization program
Under current law, DATCP must award grants under a commercial nitrogen 
optimization pilot program to agricultural producers and to UW System 
institutions that implement a project that optimizes the application of commercial 
nitrogen for at least two growing seasons.  DATCP must award the grants from an 
annual segregated appropriation account that is funded by the environmental fund.  
A grant to a farmer and the eligible UW System institution collaborating with the 
farmer may not exceed, in total, $50,000.  DATCP must attempt to provide grants 
under the program to farmers in different parts of the state and for projects in areas 
that have different soil types or geologic characteristics.
The bill removes the word XpilotY from the statutory language describing the 
program and funds the program from a new biennial segregated appropriation 
account that is funded by the environmental fund.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Truth-in-labeling requirements for milk, dairy, and wild rice
Under the bill, no person may label a food product as, or sell or offer for sale a 
food product that is labeled as, any type of milk unless the food product is cow [s 
milk, hooved or camelid mammals [ milk, or a type of dairy milk that meets certain 
specifications under federal law.
In addition, no person may label a food product as, or sell or offer for sale a food 
product that is labeled as, a type of dairy product or a dairy ingredient unless the 
food product is a dairy product or dairy ingredient that is or is derived from cow [s 
milk, hooved or camelid mammal [s milk, or a dairy product that meets certain 
specifications under federal law.
Finally, the bill prohibits any person from labeling wild rice as Xtraditionally 
harvested Y unless the wild rice is harvested using traditional wild rice harvesting 
methods of American Indian tribes or bands.  The bill requires DATCP to 
promulgate a rule defining traditional wild rice harvesting methods of American 
Indian tribes or bands.  Under the bill, DATCP must obtain the advice and 
recommendations of the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council, Inc., before 
promulgating a rule defining a traditional method of wild rice harvesting.
Appropriation limit for the producer-led watershed protection grant 
program
DATCP administers the producer-led watershed protection grant program, 
which provides grants to groups of farmers in the same watershed to implement 
nonpoint source pollution abatement activities.  Under current law, DATCP may 
not allocate more than $1,000,000 per fiscal year for this program.  The bill 
increases that maximum amount to $1,250,000.
Agricultural enterprise area maximum acreage
Under current law, DATCP may designate agricultural enterprise areas, with 
a combined area of not more than 2,000,000 acres, targeted for agricultural 
preservation and development.  The bill increases the maximum acreage for 
designated agricultural enterprise areas to 3,000,000.
Veterinary examining board appropriation uses
Current law provides an appropriation to DATCP, from all moneys received by 
the veterinary examining board when issuing or renewing credentials, for the 
purpose of supporting the activities of the board.  The bill changes this 
appropriation so that it may also be used to provide dog license tags and forms; 
perform other activities related to the regulation of dogs; administer the rabies 
control program its media campaign; and carry out activities relating to humane 
officers.  Humane officers are trained and certified officers appointed by political 
subdivisions to enforce certain regulations relating to animals.
Bonding for soil and water resource management
The bill increases the general obligation bonding authority for the Soil and 
Water Resource Management Program by $10,000,000.  The program, which is 2025 - 2026  Legislature

water conservation activities.
COMMERCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
BUSINESS  ORGANIZATIONS  AND FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS
Catastrophe savings accounts 
Under the bill, a person may establish an account at a financial institution 
and designate the account as a catastrophe savings account.  The account may be 
used to hold savings for expenses related to a catastrophic event, which is defined as 
a tornado, hurricane, or severe storm resulting in flooding, damaging hail, extreme 
wind, or extremely cold temperatures.  If the account owner maintains a property 
insurance policy covering catastrophic events, deposits in the account are limited, 
based on the amount of the policy deductible, to either $2,000 or the lesser of 
$15,000 or twice the amount of the policy deductible. Deposits in a catastrophe 
savings account may be withdrawn only to pay the following relating to property 
damage caused by a catastrophic event:  1) repair costs or other losses to the extent 
the costs or losses are not covered by a property insurance policy or are self-insured 
losses, and 2) any portion of a policy [s deductible.  A person may not be an account 
owner of more than one catastrophe savings account.  For state income tax 
purposes, the owner may subtract from taxable income the amount of the deposits

Prohibiting discrimination in broadband
The bill prohibits a broadband service provider from denying a group of 
potential residential customers access to its broadband service because of the 
group[s race or income.  Under the bill, DATCP has authority to enforce the 
prohibition and to promulgate related rules.  The bill also authorizes any person 
affected by a broadband service provider who violates the prohibition to bring a 
private action.
Broadband subscriber rights
The bill establishes various requirements for broadband service providers, 
including the following:  1) broadband service providers must provide service

experience to vary, and at least 10 days [ advance written notice of disconnecting 
service, unless the disconnection is requested by the subscriber.
Internet service provider registration
The bill requires each Internet service provider in this state to register with 
PSC.
Severe thunderstorm price gouging
Under current law, no manufacturer, producer, supplier, wholesaler, 
distributor, or retailer may sell or offer to sell consumer goods or services at 
unreasonably excessive prices if the governor by executive order has certified that 
the state or a part of the state is in a period of abnormal economic disruption due to 
an emergency.  An Xemergency Y in this context includes a destructive act of nature, 
a hostile action, terrorism, or a disruption of energy supplies that poses a risk to the 
public[s economic well-being, public health, or welfare.  A Xconsumer good or 
serviceY under the law means those goods or services that are used primarily for 
personal, family, or household purposes.
The bill prohibits residential building contractors, tree trimmers, and 
restoration and mitigation services providers that are operating within a 
geographic region impacted by, and repairing damage caused by, a severe 
thunderstorm from doing either of the following:  1)  charging an unreasonably 
excessive price for labor in comparison to the market price charged for comparable 
services in the geographic region impacted by the weather event and 2) charging an 
insurance company a rate for a consumer good or service that exceeds what the 
residential building contractor, tree trimmer, or restoration and mitigation services 
provider would otherwise charge a member of the general public for the consumer 
good or service.  XSevere thunderstorm Y is defined in the bill to mean a weather 
event in which any of the following occurs:  1) hail that is one inch or greater in 
diameter, 2) wind gusts in excess of 50 knots, or 3) a tornado.
The bill requires DATCP to promulgate rules to establish formulas or other 
standards to be used in determining whether a price for labor is unreasonably 
excessive.  Under the bill, DATCP or, after consulting with DATCP, DOJ may 
commence an action against a person that has violated the prohibition in the bill to 
recover a civil forfeiture of not more than $1,000 per violation, to temporarily or 
permanently restrain or enjoin the person from violating the prohibition in the bill, 
or both.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Sales by a municipality or county of wine in a public park
The bill allows a municipality or county to sell wine in its public parks without 
an alcohol beverage license.
Under current law, with limited exceptions, no person may sell alcohol 
beverages to a consumer unless the seller possesses a license or permit authorizing 
the sale.  Under one exception, no license or permit is required for the sale, by 
officers or employees of a county or municipality, of fermented malt beverages 
(beer) in a public park operated by the county or municipality.
The bill applies this exception to wine along with beer.
ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT
Changes to the state main street program
Under current law, WEDC is required to establish and administer a state 
main street program to coordinate state and local participation in programs offered 
by the national main street center to assist municipalities in planning, managing, 
and implementing programs for revitalization of commercial areas having historic 
significance.
Under current law, a recipient of assistance under the state main street 
program must be a city, village, or town.  Under the bill, eligible recipients include 
tribal governments, chambers of commerce, and nonprofit organizations.
The bill eliminates the requirements that WEDC contract with the national 
main street center for services related to revitalizing commercial areas having 
historic significance and develop a plan describing the objectives of the state main 
street program and the methods by which WEDC will carry out certain 
responsibilities specified by law.
The bill also eliminates the requirements that, in developing criteria for use in 
selecting participants in the state main street program, WEDC include the 
following:
1.  Local organizational and financial commitment to employ a program 
manager for not less than five years.
2.  Local assistance in paying for the services of a design consultant.
3.  Local commitment to assist in training persons to direct activities related 
to business areas in municipalities that do not participate in the state main street 
program.
Under the bill, in selecting participants in the state main street program, 
WEDC must evaluate and consider the potential in the business area selected by 
the applicant to retain small businesses, attract new businesses, generate new 
economic activity and grow the local tax base, and create new employment 
opportunities.  The bill also retains the current law requirement that WEDC 
consider private and public sector interest in and commitment to revitalization of 
the business area selected by the applicant and potential private sector investment 
in the business area selected by the applicant.
Finally, the bill changes the definition of Xbusiness area Y for the purposes of 
the state main street program from Xa commercial area existing at the time services 2025 - 2026  Legislature

Workforce housing modifications to the business development tax credit
The bill makes adjustments to the workforce housing investments award 
under the business development tax credit.  Under current law, a person may claim 
tax benefits of an amount equal to up to 15 percent of the person [s investment, 
comprised only of capital expenditures, in workforce housing for employees.  Under 
the bill, the investment in workforce housing for which a person may receive tax 
benefits may include contributions made to a third party for the building or 
rehabilitating of workforce housing, including contributions made to a local 
revolving loan fund program.  The bill also removes the requirement that the 
workforce housing for which a person may receive tax benefits for investing in be for 
employees.
Wage thresholds for business development and enterprise zone tax credits
The bill raises the minimum wage thresholds for the business development 
and enterprise zone tax credits for businesses that enter into contracts with WEDC 
after December 31, 2025.  Under current law, WEDC may certify businesses that 
engage in qualifying activities, including full-time job creation and retention, to 
claim the credits.  One requirement for claiming either credit is that the business 
enter into a contract with WEDC.  In its contracts, WEDC uses a definition of Xfull-
time employee Y that means an individual who, among other things, is paid at least 
150 percent of the federal minimum wage.  The bill changes this minimum wage 
threshold to $34,220 for the business development tax credit and to $34,220 in a 
tier I county or municipality and $45,390 in a tier II county or municipality for the 
enterprise zone tax credit, with all these amounts adjusted annually for inflation. 
Additionally, under current law, the enterprise zone tax credit is partially based on 
the wages paid to zone employees that are at least 150 percent of the federal 
minimum wage in a tier I county or municipality or $30,000 in a tier II county or 
municipality.  The bill changes these thresholds to $34,220 and $45,390, 
respectively, with both amounts adjusted annually for inflation.
The bill also modifies the maximum wage earnings limit for businesses that 
enter into contracts with WEDC after December 31, 2025.  Under current law, the 
maximum wage earnings that may be considered per employee for the enterprise 
zone tax credit is $100,000.  The bill increases this amount to $151,300, which is 
adjusted annually for inflation, and establishes the same dollar amount limit for 
the business development tax credit.
The bill also adjusts the definition of Xfull-time job Y for the purposes of the 
business development and enterprise zone jobs tax credits by removing the current 
requirement that a worker work at least 2,080 hours per year, including paid leave 
and holidays, in order to be considered Xfull-time. Y
Enterprise zone designations
Under current law, WEDC may designate any number of enterprise zones for 
purposes of certifying taxpayers to claim tax credits for certain activities carried 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 12 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
out within an enterprise zone.  However, current law subjects WEDC [s designation 
of a new enterprise zone to the approval of JCF under passive review.  The bill 
provides that WEDC may designate no more than 30 enterprise zones and 
eliminates the requirement that WEDC seek approval for a new enterprise zone 
from JCF under passive review.
Adjustment to WEDC appropriation
The bill adjusts the calculation used to determine the amount of WEDC [s GPR 
appropriation.  The bill does not raise the expenditure cap on that appropriation, 
which is $16,512,500 per fiscal year.
WEDC[s unassigned fund balance
Current law requires that WEDC establish policies and procedures concerning 
its unassigned fund balance, which is defined as all moneys held by WEDC that 
WEDC is not obligated by law or by contract to expend for a particular purpose or 
that WEDC has not otherwise assigned to be expended for a particular purpose.  
Under current law, those policies and procedures must include as a target that 
WEDC[s unassigned fund balance on June 30 of each fiscal year be an amount 
equal to or less than one-sixth of WEDC [s total administrative expenditures for that 
fiscal year.  The bill eliminates the requirement that WEDC [s policies and 
procedures include that target for WEDC [s unassigned fund balance.
Main street bounceback grants
The bill increases by $50,000,000 the amount WEDC may expend from its 
GPR appropriation for general operations and economic development programs in 
fiscal year 2025-26 for the purpose of awarding grants of $10,000 each to small 
businesses and nonprofit organizations that open a new location or expand 
operations in a vacant commercial space.  A recipient of a grant under the bill may 
use grant moneys for commercial lease and mortgage payments, business operating 
expenses, and commercial building repair and tenant improvements.
Advanced manufacturing grants
The bill increases by $5,000,000 the amount WEDC may expend from its GPR 
appropriation for general operations and economic development programs in fiscal 
year 2025-26 for the purpose of establishing a program  to award matching grants 
to small and midsized manufacturing companies located in this state to invest in 
advanced manufacturing technologies.  No one company may receive more than 
$200,000 in grants under the bill, and no one grant under the bill may be for more 
than one-third of the amount invested in advanced manufacturing technologies  by 
the company.  To receive a grant under the bill, a company must commit to not 
reduce its employment below the level when the grant is awarded.  If a company 
that receives a grant under the bill fails to meet this commitment within 10 years 
after receiving the grant, the company must repay the grant amount to WEDC.  
WEDC may provide an exemption to the repayment requirement if it finds that the 
company has undergone a unique hardship.

part of the program, WEDC may award grants directly to businesses to assist in 
their growth and development and may award grants to or in support of business 
incubators.

The bill increases by $5,000,000 the amount WEDC may expend from its GPR 
appropriation for general operations and economic development programs in fiscal 
year 2025 ]26 for the purpose of creating a tribal enterprise accelerator program to 
offer statewide technical assistance and grants for community development 
investment and capacity building to American Indian tribes or bands in this state

program.  Under the bill, WEDC must provide funding to its established regional 
and tribal partners to develop and fund projects in nonmetropolitan municipalities 
with populations of less than 10,000 to provide for increased availability and 
accessibility of local project capital.
Financing projects for qualifying tax-exempt organizations
Under current law, WHEFA may issue bonds to finance certain projects of 
health, educational, research, and other nonprofit institutions.  The bill requires 
that those health, educational, research, and other nonprofit institutions be located 
in this state, headquartered in this state, or serving a population in this state.
Financing working capital costs of certain nonprofit institutions
Under current law, WHEFA may issue bonds to finance certain projects of 
health, educational, research, and other nonprofit institutions.  The bill authorizes 
WHEFA to issue bonds for the purpose of financing such institutions [ working

LANDLORD -TENANT
Notification of building code violations
Under current law, before entering into a lease with or accepting any earnest 
money or a security deposit from a prospective tenant, a landlord must disclose to 
the prospective tenant any building code or housing code violations of which the 
landlord has actual knowledge if the violation presents a significant threat to the 
prospective tenant [s health or safety.  The bill eliminates the condition that the 
landlord have actual knowledge of such a violation and that the threat to the 
prospective tenant [s health or safety be Xsignificant Y; under the bill, the landlord 
must disclose to a prospective tenant a building code or housing code violation, 
regardless of whether the landlord has actual knowledge of the violation, if the 
violation presents a threat to the prospective tenant [s health or safety.
Local landlord-tenant ordinances, moratoria on evictions, and rental 
property inspection requirements
The bill also makes changes to local landlord-tenant ordinances, local 
moratoria on evictions, and local rental property inspection requirements.  See 
Local Government .
TOURISM
Tourism marketing funding from Indian gaming receipts
Current law requires DOA to transfer portions of Indian gaming receipts to 
the Department of Tourism for certain tourism marketing expenses.  The bill 
eliminates that requirement.  The bill leaves in place an appropriation funding the 
same purposes from GPR and from the transportation fund.
American Indian tourism marketing
The bill requires DOA to award an annual grant to the Great Lakes Inter-
Tribal Council to provide funding for a program to promote tourism featuring 
American Indian heritage and culture.  As a condition of receiving the grant, the 
Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council must include information on the tourism 
promotion program in its annual report to DOA.  The bill also transfers from the 
Department of Tourism to DOA a contract between the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal 
Council and the Department of Tourism that relates to the promotion of tourism 
featuring American Indian heritage and culture.
CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM
ADULT  CORRECTIONAL  SYSTEM
Earned compliance credit
The bill creates an earned compliance credit for time spent on extended 
supervision or parole.  Under current law, a person [s extended supervision or parole 
may be revoked if he or she violates a condition or rule of the extended supervision 
or parole.  If extended supervision or parole is revoked, the person is returned to 
prison for an amount of time up to the length of the original sentence, less any time 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 15 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
actually served in confinement and less any credit for good behavior.  Under current 
law, when extended supervision or parole is revoked, the time spent on extended 
supervision or parole is not credited as time served under the sentence.
Under the bill, an eligible inmate receives an earned compliance credit for time 
served on extended supervision or parole.  The earned compliance credit equals the 
amount of time served on extended supervision or parole without violating any 
condition or rule of extended supervision or parole.  Under the bill, a person is 
eligible to receive the earned compliance credit only if the person is not required to 
register as a sex offender and is serving a sentence for a crime that is not a specified 
violent crime or a specified crime against a child.  Under the bill, if a person [s 
extended supervision or parole is revoked, he or she may be incarcerated for up to 
the length of the original sentence, less any credit for time served in confinement, 
any credit for good behavior, and any earned compliance credit.
Earned release
Under current law, an eligible inmate may earn early release to parole or 
extended supervision by successfully completing a substance abuse program.  An 
inmate is eligible for earned release only if the inmate is serving time for a crime 
that is not a violent crime and, for an inmate who is serving a bifurcated sentence, 
the sentencing court determines that the inmate is eligible.
Under current law, DOC operates a mother-young child care program in which 
females in DOC custody who are pregnant or have a child that is less than one year 
old may be placed in less restrictive custodial placements and participate in 
services aimed at creating a stable relationship between the mother and her child 
and preparing the mother to be able to live in a safe, lawful, and stable manner in 
the community.
The bill expands the earned release program to include two new options: 1)  
successful completion of the mother-young child care program, or 2) successful 
completion of a vocational readiness program, which includes educational, 
vocational, treatment, or other qualifying evidence-based training programs to 
reduce recidivism.  The bill also provides that DOC, not the sentencing court, 
determines eligibility for earned release for all inmates.
Creating the Office of the Ombudsperson for Corrections
The bill creates the Office of the Ombudsperson for Corrections, attached to 
DOC.  The office is under the direction of an ombudsperson, who is appointed by the 
governor, is approved by a three-quarters vote of the senate, and may be removed 
only by the governor, for just cause.  Under the bill, the ombudsperson accepts 
complaints regarding facilities and abuse, unfair acts, and violations of rights of 
prisoners and juveniles from persons being held in state prisons and juvenile 
correctional facilities.  Under the bill, the ombudsperson has the power to 
investigate a variety of actions by DOC and make recommendations on the basis of 
the investigations.  If the ombudsperson determines to make a recommendation to 
a state prison or juvenile correctional facility, the superintendent of the state prison 2025 - 2026  Legislature

the ombudsperson.
Also under the bill, the Office of the Ombudsperson for Corrections must 
annually publish a report of its findings, recommendations, and investigation 
results and distribute the report to the governor, the chief clerk of each house of the 
legislature, and the secretary of corrections.
Contracts for temporary housing for or detention of persons placed on 
probation or sentenced to imprisonment 
Under current law, DOC may contract with local units of government for 
temporary housing or detention in jails or houses of correction for persons placed on 
probation or sentenced to imprisonment in state prisons or to the intensive 
sanctions program.  Under such a contract, the rate may not exceed $60 per person 
per day.  The bill increases the rate that may be set under such a contract to up to 
$80 per person per day.
JUVENILE  CORRECTIONAL  SYSTEM
Age of juvenile court jurisdiction
Under current law, a person 17 years of age or older who is alleged to have 
violated a criminal law is subject to the procedures specified in the Criminal 
Procedure Code and, on conviction, is subject to sentencing under the Criminal 
Code, which may include a sentence of imprisonment in the Wisconsin state 
prisons.  Currently, subject to certain exceptions, a person under 17 years of age 
who is alleged to have violated a criminal law is subject to the procedures specified 
in the Juvenile Justice Code and, on being adjudicated delinquent, is subject to an 
array of dispositions under that code, including placement in a juvenile correctional 
facility.  The bill raises from 17 to 18 the age at which a person who is alleged to 
have violated a criminal law is subject to the procedures specified in the Criminal 
Procedure Code and, on conviction, to sentencing under the Criminal Code.
Similarly, under current law, a person 17 years of age or older who is alleged to 
have violated a civil law or municipal ordinance is subject to the jurisdiction and 
procedures of the circuit court or, if applicable, the municipal court, while a person 
under 17 years of age who is alleged to have violated a civil law or municipal 
ordinance, subject to certain exceptions, is subject to the jurisdiction and 
procedures of the court assigned to exercise jurisdiction under the Juvenile Justice 
Code.  The bill raises from 17 to 18 the age at which a person who is alleged to have 
violated a civil law or municipal ordinance is subject to the jurisdiction and 
procedures of the circuit court or, if applicable, the municipal court.
Seventeen-year-old juvenile justice aids
The bill creates a sum sufficient appropriation under DCF for youth aids-
related purposes but only to reimburse counties, beginning on January 1, 2026, for 
costs associated with juveniles who were alleged to have violated a state or federal 
criminal law or any civil law or municipal ordinance at age 17.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Juvenile justice reform review committee
The bill creates a juvenile justice reform review committee in DCF with 
members appointed by the governor.  Under the bill, the committee is charged with 
studying and providing recommendations to DCF and DOC on how to do all of the 
following:
1.  Increase the minimum age of delinquency.
2.  Eliminate original adult court jurisdiction over juveniles.
3.  Modify the waiver procedure for adult court jurisdiction over juveniles and 
incorporate offenses currently subject to original adult court jurisdiction into the 
waiver procedure.
4.  Eliminate the serious juvenile offender program and create extended 
juvenile court jurisdiction with a blended juvenile and adult sentence structure for 
certain juvenile offenders.
5.  Prohibit placement of a juvenile in a juvenile detention facility for a status 
offense and limit sanctions and short-term holds in a juvenile detention facility to 
cases where there is a public safety risk.
6.  Sunset long-term post-disposition programs at juvenile detention facilities.
7.  Create a sentence adjustment procedure for youthful offenders.
8.  Conform with the U.S. Constitution the statutes that mandate imposing 
sentences of life imprisonment without parole or extended supervision to minors.
Under the bill, the committee terminates on September 15, 2026, and DCF 
and DOC must submit in their 2027 ]29 biennial budget requests a request to 
implement the committee [s recommendations.
Contract payments for placement of juveniles
The bill creates a sum sufficient GPR appropriation for DOC to make 
payments under contracts for the placement of juveniles.  The bill limits the 
appropriation to $20,000,000 in each fiscal year and sunsets it on July 1, 2029.
Juveniles placed at Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center
Under current law, DOC may transfer to the Mendota Juvenile Treatment 
Center (MJTC) juveniles who are under DOC [s supervision or juveniles who are 
placed in a Type 1 juvenile correctional facility regardless of whether those 
juveniles are under the supervision of DOC or a county department of social 
services or human services.  Current law requires DOC to reimburse DHS for the 
cost of providing services to these juveniles at MJTC at a per person daily cost 
specified by DHS.  The bill specifies that DOC is required to reimburse DHS only for 
the cost of services provided to juveniles who are under DOC [s supervision and are 
transferred to MJTC.
Daily rates for juvenile correctional services
Under current law, DOC charges counties for the costs of certain juvenile 
correctional services DOC provides according to a per person daily cost assessment 
specified in the statutes (daily rate).  Counties use community youth and family 
aids (youth aids) funding allocated to them from various state and federal moneys 
to pay these costs.  Under current law, the daily rate for care of a juvenile who is in 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 18 - LRB-2080/1

a Type 1 juvenile correctional facility or transferred from a juvenile correctional 
facility to an inpatient treatment facility is set at $1,268 until June 30, 2025.  The 
bill continues this daily rate until June 30, 2027.
Youth aids; allocations
Under current law, DCF is required to allocate to counties community youth 
and family aids (youth aids) funding.  Youth aids funding comes from various state 
and federal moneys and is used to pay for state-provided juvenile correctional 
services and local delinquency-related and juvenile justice services.  The bill 
updates the allocation of youth aids funding that is available to counties for the 
2025-27 fiscal biennium.
The bill eliminates current law requirements that some of the youth aids 
funding be allocated for emergencies related to youth aids, for alcohol and other 
drug abuse treatment programs, and to reimburse counties that are purchasing 
community supervision services from DOC for juveniles.  The bill also eliminates 
the community intervention program (CIP), under which DCF may award funding 
to counties for early intervention services for first offenders.  The bill replaces these 
allocations and CIP with the youth justice system improvement program.  Under 
the bill, DCF may use youth aids funding for the youth justice system improvement 
program to support diversion, prevention, and early intervention programs, to 
address emergencies related to youth aids, and to fund other activities required of 
DCF under youth aids.
Youth aids; administration
Under current law, youth aids funding is allocated to counties on a calendar 
year basis.  Youth aids funds that are not spent in the calendar year can be carried 
forward three ways:  1) DCF may carry forward 5 percent of a county [s allocation for 
that county for use in the subsequent calendar year; 2) DCF may carry forward 
$500,000 or 10 percent of its unspent youth aids funds, whichever is larger, for use 
in the subsequent two calendar years; and 3) DCF may carry forward any unspent 
emergency funds for use in the subsequent two calendar years.
The bill changes the way that unspent youth aids are carried forward.  Under 
the bill, DCF may still carry forward 5 percent of a county [s allocation for that 
county to use in the next calendar year.  However, instead of carrying forward 
$500,000 or 10 percent of its unspent youth aids funds, whichever is larger, for use 
in the next two calendar years, under the bill, DCF may transfer 10 percent of 
unspent youth aids funds to the appropriation for the youth justice system 
improvement program.
COURTS AND PROCEDURE
SUPREME  COURT  AND CIRCUIT  COURTS
Office of the Marshals of the Supreme Court
The bill creates the Office of the Marshals of the Supreme Court, to consist of 
one chief marshal of the supreme court, one deputy chief marshal of the supreme 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 19 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
court, deputy marshals of the supreme court, and administrative personnel.  The 
bill provides that the Office of the Marshals of the Supreme Court is a law 
enforcement agency and that the marshals of the supreme court are law 
enforcement officers who are employed for the purpose of detecting and preventing 
crime and enforcing laws or ordinances and are authorized to make arrests for 
violations of the laws or ordinances.  The bill requires the marshals of the supreme 
court to meet the requirements established by the Law Enforcement Standards 
Board for officer certification, police pursuit, recruitment, and firearms training 
and to comply with any other statutory requirements applicable to a law 
enforcement agency.
The bill also provides that marshals of the Supreme Court are protective 
occupation participants in the Wisconsin Retirement System.  Current law 
specifically classifies police officers, firefighters, and various other individuals as 
protective occupation participants.  Under the WRS, the normal retirement age of a 
protective occupation participant is lower than that of other participants and the 
percentage multiplier used to calculate retirement annuities is higher for protective 
occupation participants than for other participants.
The bill further provides that the Office of the Marshals of the Supreme Court 
may provide police services to the state court system, with statewide jurisdiction; 
provide protective services for the supreme court justices and their offices; provide 
security assessments for the justices, judges, and facilities of the state court system; 
and provide safety and security support services and advanced security planning 
services for circuit court proceedings.  The operation of the Office of the Marshals of 
the Supreme Court does not affect the operations or jurisdiction of sheriffs or local 
law enforcement agencies to perform courthouse security, handle active 
emergencies, perform criminal investigations, or perform any other law 
enforcement functions.
Circuit court payments
Under current law, the director of state courts must make payments to 
counties for certain circuit court costs.  Under the bill, beginning on January 1, 
2026, the director of state courts must make additional payments to circuit courts, 
including a payment that, beginning January 1, 2027, is available only to counties 
that operate an alternatives to prosecution and incarceration program.
Circuit court branches
The bill adds two additional circuit court branches for Brown County on 
August 1, 2026.
SPECIAL  PROSECUTORS  AND THE STATE  PUBLIC  DEFENDER
Compensation for special prosecutors
Under current law, the SPD provides legal representation for indigent persons 
in criminal and delinquency cases.  The SPD assigns cases either to staff attorneys 
or to local private attorneys.  A private attorney assigned to a case by the SPD is 
paid an hourly amount that varies depending on the year in which the case was 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 20 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
assigned.  For instance, a private attorney assigned a case between December 1, 
1992, and July 29, 1995, was generally paid $50 per hour for time spent related to 
the case and $25 per hour for time spent in related travel.  The amount has 
increased periodically; a private attorney assigned a case after July 1, 2023, is 
generally paid $100 per hour for time spent related to the case and $50 per hour for 
time spent in related travel.
Current law provides the same compensation to other attorneys as the 
compensation paid to a private attorney assigned to case by the SPD.  For example, 
if a judge appoints a special prosecutor to perform the duties of a district attorney, 
the special prosecutor compensation is the amount paid to a private attorney for a 
case assigned between December 1, 1992, and July 29, 1995.  The bill changes the 
compensation for the special prosecutor to be the amount paid to a private attorney 
assigned a case on the date the approval was made.
Private bar reimbursement rate for cases involving violent crimes
Under current law, the SPD provides legal representation for indigent persons 
in criminal, delinquency, and certain related cases.  The SPD assigns cases either to 
staff attorneys or to local private attorneys.  Generally, a private attorney who is 
assigned a case by the SPD on or after July 1, 2023, is paid $100 per hour for time 
spent related to the case and $50 per hour for time spent in travel related to a case.  
The bill increases the rate the private attorney is paid for cases to $125 per hour if 
the case is assigned on or after July 1, 2025, and involves a charge of a violent 
crime.  The bill does not change the rate for cases that do not involve a charge of a 
violent crime or for travel.
DISTRICT  ATTORNEYS
Increase in deputy district attorney allocation
The bill increases the number of deputy district attorneys that may be 
appointed in a prosecutorial unit with a population of 200,000 or more but less than 
750,000 from three deputy district attorneys to four deputy district attorneys.
GENERAL  COURTS  AND PROCEDURE
Privacy protection for federal judicial officers
The bill adds current and former district judges and magistrate judges for 
federal district courts in this state as well as current and former bankruptcy judges 
for federal bankruptcy courts in this state to the list of judicial officers to whom 
certain privacy protections apply.  Current law provides, upon written request, 
certain privacy protections for the personal information of judicial officers.  Among 
other protections, if a government agency receives a written request from a judicial 
officer, the government agency may not publicly post or display publicly available 
content that includes a judicial officer [s personal information.  That information is 
also exempt from inspection and copying under public records law unless the agency 
has received consent to make that information available to the public.  Under 
current law, upon written request, a data broker may not knowingly sell, license, 
trade, purchase, or otherwise make available for consideration the personal 
information of a judicial officer or a judicial officer [s immediate family.  Current law 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 21 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
also provides that, if the judicial officer has made a written request, no person, 
business, or association may publicly post or display on the Internet publicly 
available content that includes the personal information of a judicial officer or the 
judicial officer [s immediate family.  The bill allows current and former federal 
district court judges, magistrate judges, and bankruptcy judges in this state to have 
these protections.
Sharing information regarding potential jurors
Under current law, DOT annually transmits to the director of state courts a 
list of persons residing in the state that includes certain information about those 
persons.  Each year, the director of state courts uses that information to compile a 
master list of potential jurors for use by the state circuit courts.  The bill requires 
DOT to also send that list to the clerks of court for the federal district courts within 
this state.
Also under current law, the director of state courts may request and use the 
following information, in addition to the DOT information, to create the master list:  
1) a list of registered voters from the Elections Commission; 2) a list of individuals 
who filed state income tax returns with DOR; 3) a list of child support payors and 
payees from DWD; 4) a list of recipients of unemployment compensation from DWD; 
and 5) a list of state residents issued approvals or licenses from DNR.  The bill 
requires, rather than allows, the director of state courts to use that information.  
The bill also modifies the requirements for those state agencies to transmit the lists 
they maintain to the director of state courts to be similar to DOT [s obligations.  For 
example, the bill requires each state agency to annually transmit the list the agency 
maintains to the director of state courts without the need for the director of state 
courts to request the information.
Qui tam actions for false claims
The bill restores a private individual [s authority to bring a qui tam claim 
against a person who makes a false or fraudulent claim for medical assistance, 
which was eliminated in 2015 Wisconsin Act 55, and further expands qui tam 
actions to include any false or fraudulent claims to a state agency.  A qui tam claim 
is a claim initiated by a private individual on his or her own behalf and on behalf of 
the state against a person who makes a false claim relating to medical assistance or 
other moneys from a state agency.  The bill provides that a private individual may 
be awarded up to 30 percent of the amount of moneys recovered as a result of a qui 
tam claim, depending upon the extent of the individual [s contribution to the 
prosecution of the action.  The individual may also be entitled to reasonable 
expenses incurred in bringing the action, as well as attorney fees.  The bill includes 
additional changes not included in the prior law to incorporate provisions enacted 
in the federal Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and conform state law to the federal 
False Claims Act, including expanding provisions to facilitate qui tam actions and 
modifying the bases for liability to parallel the liability provisions under the federal 
False Claims Act.
In addition to qui tam claims, DOJ has independent authority to bring a claim 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 22 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
against a person for making a false claim for medical assistance.  The bill modifies 
provisions relating to DOJ [s authority to parallel the liability and penalty 
standards relating to qui tam claims and to parallel the forfeiture amounts provided 
under the federal False Claims Act.
CRIMES
Expungement
Under current law, a court may order a person [s criminal record expunged of a 
crime if all of the following apply:
1.  The maximum term of imprisonment for the crime is six years or less (Class 
H felony and below).
2.  The person committed the crime before the age of 25.
3.  The person had not been previously convicted of a felony.
4.  The crime was not a violent felony.
Current law specifies that the expungement order must be made only at 
sentencing and then the record is expunged when the person completes his or her 
sentence.  If the court does not order a criminal record expunged at sentencing, 
current law generally does not provide for another means to expunge the criminal 
record.
The bill makes several changes to the expungement process.  The bill removes 
the condition that the person committed the crime before the age of 25.  (The bill 
retains the conditions that the crime be no greater than a Class H felony, the person 
have no previous felony convictions, and the crime not be a violent felony.)  The bill 
makes certain crimes ineligible for expungement, such as traffic crimes, the crime 
of violating a domestic abuse restraining order or injunction, criminal trespass, and 
criminal damage to a business.  The bill also allows the sentencing court to order 
that a person [s record not be eligible for expungement.
The bill continues to allow the court to order at sentencing that the record be 
expunged when the person completes his or her sentence.  The bill also provides 
that, if the court did not make an order at sentencing, the person may file a petition 
with the sentencing court after he or she completes his or her sentence.  Upon 
receipt of the petition, the court must review the petition and then may order the 
record expunged or may deny the petition.  If the court denies the petition, the 
person may not file another petition for two years.  The person must pay a $100 fee 
to the county for a second petition, and no person may file more than two petitions 
per crime.  The bill limits a person to one expungement.  The changes described in 
this paragraph apply retroactively to persons who were convicted of a crime before 
the bill takes effect.
The bill provides that, if a record is expunged of a crime, that crime is not 
considered a conviction for employment purposes and specifies that employment 
discrimination because of a conviction record includes requesting a person to supply 
information regarding a crime if the record has been expunged of the crime.  
Finally, the bill provides that it is not employment discrimination because of 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 23 - LRB-2080/1

conviction record for the Law Enforcement Standards Board to consider a 
conviction that has been expunged with respect to applying any standard or 
requirement for the certification, decertification, or required training of law 
enforcement officers, tribal law enforcement officers, jail officers, and juvenile 
detention officers.
Immunity for certain controlled substances offenses
Current law grants immunity from prosecution for possessing a controlled 
substance to a person, called an aider, who summons or provides emergency 
medical assistance to another person because the aider believes the other person is 
suffering from an overdose or other adverse reaction to a controlled substance.  
Under 2017 Wisconsin Act 33, an aider was also immune from having probation, 
parole, or extended supervision revoked for possessing a controlled substance under 
the same circumstances.  Act 33 also granted the aided person immunity from from 
having probation, parole, or extended supervision revoked for possessing a 
controlled substance when an aider seeks assistance for the aided person.  The 
immunity applied only if the aided person completes a treatment program as part of 
his or her probation, parole, or extended supervision.  Act 33 also provided that a 
prosecutor must offer an aided person who is subject to prosecution for possessing a 
controlled substance a deferred prosecution agreement if the aided person 
completes a treatment program.
The expanded immunities under 2017 Wisconsin Act 33 were temporary, and 
expired on August 1, 2020.  The bill permanently restores these expanded 
immunities from 2017 Wisconsin Act 33.
Alternatives to prosecution for disorderly conduct
The bill requires a prosecutor to offer to certain disorderly conduct defendants 
a deferred prosecution agreement or an agreement in which the defendant 
stipulates to his or her guilt of a noncriminal ordinance violation.  Under the bill, a 
prosecutor must offer alternatives to prosecution to a person who has committed a 
disorderly conduct violation if it is the person [s first disorderly conduct violation, 
the person has not committed a similar violation previously, and the person has not 
committed a felony in the previous three years.  Under the bill, if the person is 
offered a deferred prosecution agreement, he or she must be required to pay 
restitution, if applicable.
EDUCATION
PRIMARY  AND SECONDARY  EDUCATION : GENERAL  AIDS  AND REVENUE  LIMITS
Per pupil revenue limit adjustment
Current law generally limits the total amount of revenue per pupil that a 
school district may receive from general school aids and property taxes in a school 
year to the amount of revenue allowed per pupil in the previous school year plus a 
per pupil adjustment, if any, as provided by law.  Current law provides a $325 per 
pupil adjustment each school year from 2023 to 2425.  Under the bill, beginning in 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 24 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
the 2026 ]27 school year, the per pupil adjustment is the per pupil increase for the 
previous school year as adjusted for any increase in the consumer price index.
Low revenue ceiling; per pupil amount and restrictions
Current law provides a minimum per pupil revenue limit for school districts, 
known as the revenue ceiling.  Under current law, the per pupil revenue ceiling is 
$11,000.  The bill increases the per pupil revenue ceiling to $12,000 for the 2025 ]26 
school year and to $12,400 for the 2026 ]27 school year and each subsequent school 
year.
Current law also provides that during the three school years following a school 
year in which an operating referendum fails in a school district, the school district [s 
revenue ceiling is the revenue ceiling that applied in the school year during which 
the referendum was held.  The bill eliminates the provision under which a school 
district[s revenue ceiling is the revenue ceiling from a previous school year because 
an operating referendum failed in the school district.
Revenue limits; personal property tax repeal aid
For purposes of school district revenue limits, current law defines Xstate aid Y 
as general school aid, computer aid, and exempt personal property aid.  The bill 
adds personal property tax repeal aid to the definition of Xstate aid. Y
Special adjustment aid
Under current law, a school district is guaranteed an amount of general 
equalization aid equal to at least 85 percent of the amount it received in the 
previous school year.  The bill increases the amount of general equalization aid that 
a school district is guaranteed to receive to an amount that is at least 90 percent of 
the amount it received in the previous school year.
Counting four-year-old kindergarten pupils
The bill changes how a pupil enrolled in a four-year-old kindergarten is 
counted by a school district for purposes of state aid and revenue limits.  Under 
current law, a pupil enrolled in a four-year-old kindergarten program is counted as 
0.5 pupil unless the program provides at least 87.5 additional hours of outreach 
activities, in which case the pupil is counted as 0.6 pupil.  Under the bill, if the four-
year-old kindergarten program requires full-day attendance by pupils for five days 
a week, a pupil enrolled in the program is counted as one pupil.
PRIMARY  AND SECONDARY  EDUCATION : CATEGORICAL  AIDS
Per pupil aid
Under current law, per pupil aid is a categorical aid paid to school districts.  
Per pupil aid is funded from a sum sufficient appropriation and is not considered for 
purposes of revenue limits.  Under current law, the amount of per pupil aid paid to 
a school district is calculated using a three-year average of the number of pupils 
enrolled in the school district and a per pupil amount set by law.  In the 2024 ]25 
school year, the per pupil amount is $742.  Under the bill, the per pupil amount is 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 25 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
$800 in the 2025 ]26 school year and $850 in the 2026 ]27 school year and each year 
thereafter.
In addition, beginning in the 2025 ]26 school year, the bill requires DPI to pay 
a second amount of per pupil aid to school districts based on the number of 
economically disadvantaged pupils enrolled in a school district.  Under the bill, 
beginning in the 2025 ]26 school year, in addition to the base amount of per pupil 
aid, DPI must also pay a school district an additional amount equal to 20 percent of 
the standard per pupil amount for each economically disadvantaged pupil enrolled 
in the school district in the previous year.  Under the bill, an economically 
disadvantaged pupil is a pupil who satisfies either the income eligibility criteria for 
a free or reduced-price lunch under federal law or other measures of poverty, as 
determined by DPI.
Funding for special education and school age parents programs
The bill changes the rate at which the state reimburses school boards, 
operators of independent charter schools, cooperative educational service agencies 
(CESAs), and county children with disabilities education boards (CCDEBs) for costs 
incurred to provide special education and related services to children with 
disabilities and for school age parents programs (eligible costs).  Under current law, 
the state reimburses the full cost of special education for children in hospitals and 
convalescent homes for orthopedically disabled children.  After those costs are paid, 
the state reimburses remaining eligible costs from the amount remaining in the 
appropriation account at a rate that distributes the full amount appropriated.
The bill changes the appropriation to a sum sufficient and provides that, 
beginning in the 2025 ]26 school year, after full payment of hospital and 
convalescent home costs, the remaining costs are reimbursed at 60 percent of 
eligible costs.
Currently, DPI provides 1) special education aid to school districts, 
independent charter schools, CESAs, and CCDEBs; 2) aid to school districts, 
CESAs, and CCDEBs for providing physical or mental health treatment services to 
private school and tribal school pupils; and 3) aid for school age parents programs to 
school districts only.
High-cost special education aid
The bill changes the rate at which the state reimburses school boards, 
operators of independent charter schools, CESAs, and CCDEBs for 
nonadministrative costs in excess of $30,000 incurred for providing special 
education and related costs to a child (aidable costs).  Under current law, DPI must 
reimburse 90 percent of aidable costs at a rate of 100 percent from a sum certain 
appropriation.  If the amount of the appropriation is insufficient to pay the full 90 
percent of aidable costs, DPI must prorate payments among eligible applicants.  
The bill changes the appropriation to a sum sufficient appropriation and provides 
that, beginning in the 2025-26 school year, DPI must reimburse 90 percent of 
aidable costs at a rate of 40 percent.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Sparsity aid
Under current law, a school district is eligible for sparsity aid if the number of 
pupils per square mile in the school district is less than 10 and the school district [s 
membership in the previous school year did not exceed 1,000 pupils.  The amount of 
aid is $400 per pupil if the school district [s membership in the previous school year 
did not exceed 745 pupils and $100 per pupil if the school district [s membership in 
the previous school year was between 745 and 1,000 pupils.  Beginning in the 
2025‑26 school year, the bill increases these payment amounts to $500 and $200, 
respectively.
Current law also provides a reduced payment, known as a stop gap payment, 
to a school district that was eligible to receive sparsity aid in the previous school 
year but is not eligible to receive sparsity aid in the current school year because it no 
longer satisfies the pupils-per-square-mile requirement.  The amount of the stop 
gap payment is 50 percent of the amount of sparsity aid the school district received 
in the previous school year.  Under the bill, beginning in the 2025 ]26 school year, a 
school district is eligible for a sparsity aid stop gap payment if the school district is 
ineligible for sparsity aid in the current school year because it no longer satisfies 
the pupils-per-square-mile requirement or the membership requirement.
Pupil transportation aid
Under current law, a school district or an operator of a charter school that 
provides transportation to and from a school receives a state aid payment for 
transportation.  The amount of the aid payment depends on the number of pupils 
transported and the distance of each pupil [s residence from the school.  The bill 
increases aid payments for pupils who reside more than 12 miles from the school 
from $400 per pupil to $450 per pupil, beginning in the 2025 ]26 school year.
High cost transportation aid; eligibility
Under current law, a school district is eligible for high cost transportation aid 
if 1) the school district has a pupil population density of 50 or fewer pupils per 
square mile and 2) the school district [s per pupil transportation cost exceeds 140 
percent of the statewide average per pupil transportation cost.  The bill lowers the 
second eligibility criterion to a per pupil transportation cost that exceeds 135 
percent of the statewide average per pupil transportation cost.
Supplemental nutrition aid
The bill creates supplemental nutrition aid, a categorical aid to reimburse 
educational agencies for school meals provided to pupils who satisfy the income 
criteria for a reduced-price lunch under the federal school lunch program and 
pupils who do not satisfy the income criteria for a free or reduced-price lunch under 
the federal school lunch program.  An educational agency is eligible for 
supplemental nutrition aid if the educational agency does not charge pupils for 
school meals for which the educational agency receives reimbursement from the 
federal government.  Under the bill, the amount of aid is equal to the sum of 1) the 
number of school meals provided in the previous school year to pupils who satisfy 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 27 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
the income criteria for a reduced-price lunch multiplied by the difference between 
the free-meal reimbursement amount and the reduced-price-meal reimbursement 
amount and 2) the number of school meals provided in the previous year to pupils 
who do not satisfy the income criteria for a free or reduced-price lunch multiplied by 
the difference between the free-meal reimbursement amount and the 
reimbursement amount for a paid school meal.  Supplemental nutrition aid is first 
paid to educational agencies in the 2026 ]27 school year for school meals provided 
during the 2025 ]26 school year.  Under the bill, supplemental nutrition aid is 
funded by a sum sufficient appropriation, which ensures that educational agencies 
receive the full amount of aid to which they are entitled.
The bill defines a Xschool meal Y as a school lunch or snack under the federal 
school lunch program and a breakfast under the federal school breakfast program 
and an Xeducational agency Y as a school board, an operator of an independent 
charter school, the director of the Wisconsin Educational Services Program for the 
Deaf and Hard of Hearing, the director of the Wisconsin Center for the Blind and 
Visually Impaired, an operator of a residential care center for children and youth, a 
tribal school, or a private school.
School breakfast program
The bill expands eligibility for reimbursement under the school breakfast 
program to include operators of independent charter schools, the director of the 
Wisconsin Educational Services Program for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, the 
director of the Wisconsin Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired, and operators 
of residential care centers for children and youth.  The bill also prohibits DPI from 
making a reimbursement for a breakfast served at a school in the previous school 
year if that school ceased operations during the prior school year.  This prohibition 
does not apply to reimbursements to a school district.
School mental health and pupil wellness; categorical aid
The bill changes the types of expenditures that are eligible for reimbursement 
under the state categorical aid program related to pupil mental health.
Under current law, DPI must make payments to school districts, independent 
charter schools, and private schools participating in parental choice programs (local 
education agencies) that increased the amount they spent to employ, hire, or retain 
social workers.  Under current law, DPI first pays each eligible local education 
agency 50 percent of the amount by which the eligible local education agency 
increased its expenditures for social workers in the preceding school year over the 
amount it expended in the school year immediately preceding the preceding school 
year.  If, after making those payments, there is money remaining in the 
appropriation account for that aid program, DPI makes additional payments to 
eligible local education agencies.  The amount of those additional payments is 
determined based on the amount remaining in the appropriation account and the 
amount spent by eligible local education agencies to employ, hire, and retain social 
workers during the previous school year.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 28 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
The bill expands eligibility for the payments under the aid program to include 
spending on school counselors, school social workers, school psychologists, and 
school nurses (pupil services professionals).  The bill also eliminates the two tier 
reimbursement structure of the aid program and eliminates the requirement that a 
local education agency is eligible for the aid only if the local education agency 
increased its spending.  Under the bill, any local education agency that made 
expenditures to employ, hire, or retain pupil services professionals during the 
previous school year is eligible for reimbursement under the aid program.
Aid for comprehensive school mental health services
Under current law, DPI awards grants to school districts and independent 
charter schools for the purpose of collaborating with community mental health 
agencies to provide mental health services to pupils.  The bill replaces the current 
grant program with new categorical aid for comprehensive school mental health 
services to school districts and independent charter schools.
Under the bill, beginning in the 2025 ]26 school year, DPI must annually 
reimburse a school board or the operator of an independent charter school for costs 
incurred for mental health services during in-school or out-of-school time, up to the 
greater of $100,000 or $100 per pupil who was enrolled in the school district or 
independent charter school in the previous school year.  If the amount appropriated 
for this purpose is insufficient, DPI must prorate the reimbursements.
Peer-to-peer suicide prevention grants
Under current law, DPI administers a competitive grant program to award 
grants to public, private, and tribal high schools for the purpose of supporting peer-
to-peer suicide prevention programs.  Under current law, the maximum annual 
peer-to-peer suicide prevention grant amount is $1,000.  The bill increases the 
maximum annual peer-to-peer suicide prevention grant amount to $6,000.
Mental health training programs
Under current law, DPI must establish a mental health training program 
under which it provides training to school district and independent charter school 
staff on three specific evidence-based strategies related to addressing mental 
health issues in schools.  The three specific evidence-based strategies are 1) the 
Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment program, 2) Trauma 
Sensitive Schools, and 3) Youth Mental Health First Aid.
The bill expands the mental health training program to include training on 
any evidence-based strategy related to addressing mental health issues and suicide 
prevention in schools and converts the list of evidence-based strategies under 
current law to a nonexclusive list of strategies.  Additionally, the bill requires that 
DPI provide the training to out-of-school-time program employees.
Aid for English language acquisition
The bill creates a new categorical aid for school districts and independent 
charter schools to offset the costs of educating limited-English proficient (LEP) 
pupils.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 29 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
Under current law, a school board is required to provide a bilingual-bicultural 
education program to LEP pupils who attend a school in the school district if the 
school meets any of the following thresholds:
1. Within a language group, 10 or more LEP pupils are enrolled in 
kindergarten to grade 3.
2. Within a language group, 20 or more LEP pupils are enrolled in grades 4 to 
8.
3. Within a language group, 20 or more LEP pupils are enrolled in grades 9 to 
12.
All school boards are required to educate all LEP pupils, but only school 
boards that are required to provide bilingual-bicultural education programs are 
eligible under current law for categorical aid targeted toward educating LEP pupils.  
Under current law, in each school year, DPI distributes $250,000 among eligible 
school districts whose enrollments in the previous school year were at least 15 
percent LEP pupils, and DPI distributes the amount remaining in the 
appropriation account to eligible school districts on the basis of the school districts [ 
expenditures on the required bilingual-bicultural education programs during the 
prior school year.
Under the bill, beginning in the 2025 ]26 school year, DPI must annually pay 
each school district and each operator of an independent charter school an amount 
equal to $500 times the number of LEP pupils enrolled in the school district or 
attending the charter school in the previous school year.  This new categorical aid is 
in addition to aid already paid under current law and is not conditioned on whether 
the school board or independent charter school is required to provide a bilingual-
bicultural education program.
Early literacy summer reading programs
Current law requires DPI to establish a model policy for promoting third grade 
pupils to the fourth grade that includes various components, including a 
requirement to provide an intensive summer reading program to pupils who are 
promoted to the fourth grade, had a personal reading plan in the third grade, and 
did not complete the plan before being promoted to fourth grade.  Current law 
specifies that the model policy must require that the intensive summer reading 
program be provided until a pupil scores at grade level in reading on a summative 
assessment.  Current law also requires school boards, operators of independent 
charter schools, and private schools participating in a parental choice program to, 
by July 1, 2025, adopt a written policy for promoting third grade pupils to the fourth 
grade that includes the intensive summer reading program required to be in DPI [s 
model policy.
Beginning in the 2026 ]27 school year, the bill requires DPI to reimburse 
school boards and independent charter schools for providing intensive summer 
reading programs, as required under third grade promotion policies.
Financial literacy curriculum grants

literacy curricula.  The bill further requires DPI to prioritize grants that support 
innovative financial literacy curricula.  Current law requires school boards to adopt 
academic standards for financial literacy and incorporate financial literacy 
instruction into the curriculum in grades kindergarten to 12.
Computer science education grants
The bill requires DPI to annually award grants to school districts for the 
purpose of expanding computer science educational opportunities in all grade levels 
in the school district.
Aid for career and technical education
The bill creates a categorical aid for school districts and independent charter 
schools for the purpose of increasing high school career and technical education 
pathways in public high schools.  The bill defines a Xhigh school career and 
technical education pathway Y as a series of career and technical education 
opportunities that prepare a pupil for a postsecondary option in a specific career 
area.  Under the bill, DPI must pay each school district and independent charter 
school a proportional amount of the amount appropriated for this purpose.  The 
proportional amount is based on the number of pupils in the high school grades in 
that school district or independent charter school in the previous school year 
divided by the total number of pupils in the high school grades in all school districts 
and independent charter schools in the previous school year.
Water bottle filling station grants
The bill requires DPI to award grants to school districts and independent 
charter schools to modify water fountains to include water bottle filling stations 
that provide filtered drinking water.
Tribal language revitalization grants
Under current law, school boards, cooperative educational service agencies, 
and head start agencies are eligible for grants to support innovative, effective 
instruction in one or more American Indian languages.  The bill expands eligibility 
for these grants to include independent charter schools.
Grants to replace race-based nicknames, logos, mascots, or team names 
associated with American Indians
The bill authorizes DPI to award a grant to a school board that terminates the 
use of a race-based nickname, logo, mascot, or team name that is associated with a 
federally recognized American Indian tribe or American Indians, in general.  Under 
the bill, a school board is eligible for a grant regardless of whether or not the school 
board decides to terminate the use of a race-based nickname, logo, mascot, or team 
name voluntarily, in response to an objection to its use, or in compliance with an 
order issued by the Division of Hearings and Appeals.  The bill specifies that the 
amount of the grant may not exceed the greater of $50,000 or the actual cost 
incurred by the school board to replace the race-based nickname, logo, mascot, or 
team name.  Under the bill, these grants are funded from Indian gaming receipts.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Parental choice program caps
The bill caps the total number of pupils who may participate in the Milwaukee 
Parental Choice Program, the Racine Parental Choice Program, or the statewide 
parental choice program (parental choice program) at the number of pupils who 
attended a private school under the parental choice program in the 2025 ]26 school 
year.  Under the bill, beginning in the 2026 ]27 school year, if the number of 
applications to participate in a parental choice program exceeds the program cap, 
DPI must determine which applications to accept on a random basis, subject to 
certain admission preferences that exist under current law.
Under current law, pupils may submit applications to attend a private school 
under the statewide parental choice program for the following school year from the 
first weekday in February to the third Thursday in April, and a private school that 
receives applications must, no later than the first weekday in May immediately 
following the application period, report the number of applicants to DPI so that DPI 
may determine whether a pupil participation limitation has been exceeded.  The bill 
provides that, beginning with applications for the 2026 ]27 school year, DPI must 
establish one or more application periods during which pupils may submit 
applications to attend a private school under the Milwaukee Parental Choice 
Program or Racine Parental Choice Program.  The bill provides that a private 
school that receives applications during an application period must, no later than 
10 days after the application period ends, report the number of applicants to DPI so 
that DPI may determine whether a program cap has been exceeded.  The bill does 
not change the application period for the statewide parental choice program and 
requires DPI to use the information required to be reported under current law to 
determine whether the program cap for the statewide parental choice program has 
been exceeded.
The bill also requires DPI to establish a waiting list for a parental choice 
program if the program cap for the parental choice program has been exceeded.
Special Needs Scholarship Program cap
Under current law, a child with a disability who meets certain eligibility 
criteria may receive a scholarship to attend a private school participating in the 
Special Needs Scholarship Program (SNSP).  The bill caps the total number of 
children who may receive an SNSP scholarship at the number of children who 
received an SNSP scholarship in the 2025 ]26 school year.  Under the bill, beginning 
in the 2026 ]27 school year, if the number of applications for SNSP scholarships 
exceeds the program cap, DPI must determine which applications to accept on a 
random basis, subject to certain admission preferences set forth in the bill.
Under current law, a child may apply for an SNSP scholarship at any time 
during a school year and may begin attending the school at any time during the 
school year.  The bill provides that, beginning with applications for the 2026 ]27 2025 - 2026  Legislature

period, report the number of applicants to DPI so that DPI may determine whether 
the program cap has been exceeded.
The bill also requires DPI to establish a waiting list if the program cap for the 
SNSP has been exceeded.
Wisconsin parental choice program; pupil participation limit
Current law includes a limit on the percentage of pupils in each school district 
who may attend a private school under the statewide parental choice program.  The 
pupil participation limit started in the 2015 ]16 school year at 1 percent of a school 
district[s membership and increased gradually to 10 percent of a school district [s 
membership in the 2025 ]26 school year.  Under current law, the pupil participation 
limit sunsets after the 2025 ]26 school year.  The bill eliminates the sunset and 
continues the pupil participation limit at 10 percent of a school district [s 
membership.
Payment indexing: parental choice programs, SNSP, independent charter 
schools, full-time Open Enrollment Program, and whole grade sharing 
agreements
Under current law, the per pupil payment amounts under parental choice 
programs and the SNSP, the per pupil payment amount to independent charter 
schools, the transfer amounts under the full-time open enrollment program, and 
the required transfer amount for a child with a disability in a whole grade sharing 
agreement (collectively, Xper pupil payments Y) are adjusted annually.  The annual 
adjustment for per pupil payments is an amount equal to the sum of any per 
member revenue limit increase that applies to school districts in that school year 
and any per member increase in categorical aids between the current school year 
and the previous school year.  Under the bill, beginning in the 2025 ]26 school year, 
the annual adjustment for per pupil payments is the sum of the per member 
revenue limit increase that applies to school districts in that school year, if any, and 
the increase in the per member amount of general per pupil aid paid to school 
districts between the previous school year and the current school year, if any.
Per pupil payment and transfer amount based on actual costs; SNSP and 
full-time Open Enrollment
Under current law, the per pupil payment amount for a child participating in 
the SNSP and the transfer amount for a child with a disability in the full-time Open 
Enrollment Program (OEP) is one of the following:
1.  A per pupil amount set by law.
2.  An alternative amount based on the actual costs to educate the pupil in the 
previous school year, as reported by the private school or nonresident school 
district, whichever is applicable. For example, under this option, the amount paid to 2025 - 2026  Legislature

year is based on the actual costs to educate the pupil in the 2023 ]24 school year, as 
reported by the private school or nonresident school district.
The bill eliminates the alternative SNSP per pupil payment amount and OEP 
transfer amount based on the actual costs to educate the pupil and the processes for 
setting these alternative amounts.  Under the bill, the SNSP per pupil payment 
amount and the OEP transfer amount for children with disabilities is the same for 
all pupils and is set by law.  In the 2024 ]25 school year, the amount set by law is 
$15,409.
Teacher licensure in parental choice programs and in the SNSP
With certain exceptions, the bill requires that, beginning on July 1, 2028, 
teachers at private schools participating in a parental choice program or in the 
SNSP must hold a license or permit issued by DPI.  Under current law, teachers at 
choice schools must have at least a bachelor [s degree from a nationally or regionally 
accredited institution of higher education, but they are not required to be licensed 
by DPI.  There are no current law requirements regarding who may teach at SNSP 
schools.
The bill provides an exception for a teacher who teaches only courses in 
rabbinical studies.  In addition, the bill provides a grace period for a teacher who 
has been teaching for at least the five consecutive years immediately preceding July 
1, 2028, which allows the teacher to apply for a temporary, nonrenewable waiver of 
the licensure requirement.  An applicant for a waiver must submit a plan for 
becoming licensed as required under the bill.
SNSP; religious opt out
The bill provides that a private school participating in the SNSP must allow a 
child attending the private school under the SNSP to refrain from participating in 
any religious activity if the child [s parent submits to the child [s teacher or the 
private school [s principal a written request that the child be exempt from such 
activities.
SNSP; accreditation or participation in another choice program
The bill provides that, with certain exceptions explained below, a private 
school may participate in the SNSP only if 1) the private school is accredited by 
August 1 of the school year in which the private school participates or 2) the private 
school participates in a parental choice program.  Under current law, a private 
school may participate in the SNSP if the private school is accredited or if the 
private school [s educational program meets certain criteria.
The bill provides that, if a private school is participating in the SNSP in the 
2025-26 school year and is not accredited by August 1, 2025, the private school must 
1) obtain preaccreditation by August 1, 2026; 2) apply for accreditation by December

Health emergencies in learning places grants
The bill requires school boards, independent charter schools, and private 
schools participating in a parental choice program or the SNSP (local educational 
agencies) to have 1) a cardiac emergency response plan for cardiac emergencies that 
occur on school property, 2) an adequate supply of opioid antagonists on site, and 3) 
a carbon monoxide detector in each room of a school that contains a fuel-burning, 
forced-air furnace or a boiler, or as otherwise required by DSPS.  The bill also 
requires DPI to provide aid to local educational agencies for the costs of complying 
with these requirements.
Beginning in the 2025 ]26 school year, the bill requires each local educational 
agency to have in effect a cardiac emergency response plan (CERP) for cardiac 
emergencies that occur on school property.  Under the bill, a CERP is a written 
document that establishes specific steps to reduce death from cardiac arrest in a 
specific setting.  Under the bill, a CERP must include various components, 
including a cardiac emergency response team; information on how the cardiac 
emergency response team is activated in the event of an emergency; and 
requirements for automated external defibrillator placement, maintenance, and 
training in usage, training in first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 
drills to practice the CERP.
Under current law, school boards and governing bodies of private schools must 
supply a standard first aid kit for use in an emergency.  Under the bill, independent 
charter schools must also supply a standard first aid kit for use in an emergency.  
Current law also authorizes certain school personnel, including employees and 
volunteers of public and private schools, to administer an opioid antagonist to a 
person who appears to be undergoing an opioid-related drug overdose.  Most 
recently, 2023 Wisconsin Act 194 provided civil immunity to elementary and 
secondary schools, school personnel, and particular medical professionals who 
provide or administer an opioid antagonist.
Under the bill, each local educational agency must ensure that each school 
maintains a usable supply of an opioid antagonist on site, in a place that is 
accessible at all times.
Under current law, DPI must establish a model management plan for 
maintaining indoor environmental quality in public and private schools.  By no 
later than July 1, 2026, the bill requires DPI to include in that model plan that 
public and private schools must have a carbon monoxide detector in each room in a 
school that contains a fuel-burning, forced-air furnace or a boiler, and as otherwise 
required by DSPS.
Under current law, school boards and private schools participating in a 
parental choice program must have and implement a plan for maintaining indoor 
environmental quality in schools.  The bill extends this requirement to independent 
charter schools.  Additionally, the bill requires that, by no later than October 1,

requirement that is included in DPI [s model plan.  Under the bill, each local 
educational agency must implement the carbon monoxide detector requirement by 
no later than July 1, 2027.  The bill also requires local educational agencies to 
reasonably maintain all carbon monoxide detectors as specified in the detectors [ 
instructions.  The requirements related to carbon monoxide detectors do not apply 
to a local educational agency that is a private school participating only in the SNSP.
Under current law generally, carbon monoxide detectors are required in 
dwellings with an attached garage, a fireplace, or a fuel-burning appliance.  Carbon 
monoxide detectors are also required in public buildings that are used for sleeping 
or lodging and contain a fuel-burning appliance, a fuel-burning forced-air furnace, 
or an attached garage.
Costs of placing school resource officers in MPS schools
Current law requires the school board of a first class city school 
district—currently only Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS)—to ensure that at least 
25 school resource officers are present at schools within the school district during 
normal school hours and that school resource officers are available, as needed, 
during before-school and after-school care, extracurricular activities, and sporting 
events (SRO requirement).  Under current law, a school resource officer (SRO) is a 
law enforcement officer who is deployed in community-oriented policing and 
assigned by the law enforcement agency that employs him or her to work in a full-
time capacity in collaboration with a school district.  Current law also requires MPS 
and the City of Milwaukee to agree on how to apportion the costs of meeting the 
SRO requirement between the two entities.  Under the bill, MPS and the City of 
Milwaukee must apportion the costs of meeting the SRO requirement as follows:
1.  For school days, the greater of 25 percent of the costs or $400,000, as 
indexed to inflation, to MPS and the remainder to the City of Milwaukee.
2.  For nonschool days, 100 percent to the City of Milwaukee.
Under the bill, Xschool day Y means 1) a day on which school is actually taught 
and 2) a day on which school is not taught because school is closed due to inclement 
weather, parent-teacher conferences, an order of a local health officer or DHS, or a 
threat to the health or safety of pupils or school personnel.
Computer science course requirement
The bill requires school boards, independent charter schools, and private 
schools participating in a parental choice program to make available to pupils in 
grades 9 to 12 at least one computer science course, which must include concepts in 
computer programming or coding.
Participation in high school graduation ceremonies
The bill prohibits school boards, independent charter schools, and private 
schools participating in a parental choice program or the SNSP from excluding a 
pupil from a high school graduation ceremony due to the pupil [s or the pupil [s 
family[s failure to pay any outstanding fees or charges.  Under current law, pupil 2025 - 2026  Legislature

board, charter school, or private school policies.
Access to period products in schools
The bill requires school boards and independent charter schools to provide 
period products to any pupil who needs them while at school, at no charge to the 
pupil.  In addition, the bill requires DPI to distribute aid for the provision of period 
products to certain school districts and independent charter schools.  Under the 
bill, a school district or independent charter school is eligible for aid if the school 
district or independent charter school had a greater percentage of economically 
disadvantaged pupils enrolled in or attending the school district or independent 
charter school than the statewide percentage of economically disadvantaged pupils 
in the previous school year.  Under the bill, DPI must distribute to each eligible 
school district and independent charter school the greater of $100 or an amount 
that is proportionate to the number of economically disadvantaged pupils enrolled 
in or attending the eligible school district or independent charter school in the 
previous school year compared to the total number of economically disadvantaged 
pupils enrolled in or attending eligible school districts or independent charter 
schools in the previous school year.  If the amount appropriated for this aid is 
insufficient to pay the full amount of aid, DPI must prorate the aid payments 
among the eligible school districts and independent charter schools.  The bill 
defines an Xeconomically disadvantaged pupil Y as a pupil who satisfies the federal 
income eligibility requirements for a free or reduced-price lunch.
PRIMARY  AND SECONDARY  EDUCATION : ADMINISTRATIVE  AND OTHER  FUNDING
Early literacy coaches
Under current law, the Office of Literacy in DPI must establish and supervise 
a literacy coaching program to improve literacy outcomes in this state. Specifically, 
the Office of Literacy, in consultation with cooperative educational service agencies, 
must contract for up to 64 full-time equivalent literacy coaches. Current law 
requires the Office of Literacy to assign one-half of the literacy coaches to schools 
based on pupil scores on the third grade reading assessment and one-half of the 
literacy coaches to schools that request early literacy support.  The latter half of the 
literacy coaches must be dispersed evenly among cooperative educational service 
agency regions.  In addition, current law prohibits the Office of Literacy from 
assigning more than a total of 10 literacy coaches to a first class city school district 
and more than a total of four literacy coaches to a school district that is not a first 
class city school district.
Under current law, the Office of Literacy and the literacy coaching program 
sunset on July 1, 2028.  The bill eliminates this sunset.  Beginning in the 2026 ]27 
school year, the bill increases the maximum number of full-time equivalent literacy 
coaches to 100, increases the maximum number of literacy coaches that may be 
assigned to a first class city school district to 16, and increases the maximum 
number of literacy coaches that may be assigned to a school district that is not a 
first class city school district to six.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Early literacy tutoring grants
The bill requires DPI to create a competitive grant program, under which it 
awards grants to community-based nonprofit organizations to provide literacy 
tutoring, including high-dosage literacy tutoring, to pupils who are in five-year-old 
kindergarten to third grade and do not yet read at grade-level.  The bill defines 
Xliteracy tutoring Y as tutoring that includes science-based early reading instruction 
and does not include three cueing.  High-dosage literacy tutoring is defined under 
the bill as literacy tutoring that is provided in a one-on-one or small group setting, 
at least three times per week for at least 30 minutes each session, by the same tutor 
who is professionally trained and receives ongoing training, that includes high-
quality instructional materials that align with classroom content, and that is held 
during school hours.
Early childhood special education; coaches
Under current law, school boards and operators of independent charter schools 
must identify, locate, and evaluate children with disabilities who are in need of 
special education and related services and make available a free appropriate public 
education to those children if they are at least three years old.  The process of 
identifying, locating, and evaluating children with disabilities who may need 
special education or related services is known as XChild Find. Y
The bill provides $600,000 in funding for DPI to contract with cooperative 
educational service agencies to employ regional child care collaboration coaches to 
promote Child Find to child care providers and provide training, technical 
assistance, and consultation to, and facilitate collaboration between, child care 
providers, operators of independent charter schools, and school boards for the 
purpose of providing special education and related services to children with 
disabilities.
Transferring Head Start state supplement to DCF
The bill transfers the Head Start state supplement from DPI to DCF.  The bill 
transfers from the state superintendent to the secretary of children and families the 
responsibilities of determining whether agencies are eligible for designation as 
Head Start agencies under the federal Head Start program to provide 
comprehensive health, educational, nutritional, social, and other services to 
economically disadvantaged children and their families, and of distributing federal 
Head Start funds to those eligible agencies.
Community-based 4K approach
Under current law, a school board may, but is not required to, provide four-
year-old kindergarten (4K).  Currently, many school boards provide 4K using a 
public-private partnership approach, often referred to as the community approach.  
The community approach includes contracts between school boards and 
community-based providers that define the roles and responsibilities of the parties 
related to the operation of a 4K program.
Under the bill, DPI must, in consultation with DCF, develop a model 
community-based approach 4K contract by January 1, 2026.  DPI must also, in 2025 - 2026  Legislature

the community-based provider under the model contract.
Career and technical student organizations; grants
Under current law, DPI must maintain a career and technical student 
organizations (CTSO) team that consists of six consultants, each of whom is 
assigned an educational area.  Specifically, DPI [s CTSO team must have a 
consultant in agriculture education, business education, technology education, 
family and consumer sciences education, marketing education, and health science 
education.  Under the bill, DPI must annually identify one CTSO for each of these 
educational areas and distribute state funding to each identified CTSO based on 
the number of pupils who were members of the CTSO in the previous school year.
Teacher apprenticeship pathway to licensure
The bill requires DPI to issue an initial license to teach to an individual who 
holds a bachelor [s degree,  successfully completes a teacher apprenticeship offered 
through DWD, and if the initial license is to teach in grades kindergarten to five, to 
teach in special education, or to teach as a reading teacher or specialist, pass an 
examination identical to the Foundations of Reading test, commonly called the 
FORT.  The bill also requires DPI to consult with DWD in the creation of DWD [s 
teacher apprenticeship program so that an individual who completes DWD [s 
teacher apprenticeship program will satisfy many of the requirements to obtain a 
license to teach from DPI, including the requirement that an applicant receive 
instruction in the study of minority group relations, that an applicant demonstrate 
competency related to various conflict resolution skills, and that an applicant for a 
license to teach reading or language arts to prekindergarten class to sixth grade 
successfully completes instruction in science-based early reading instruction.  See  
Employment .
Grow Your Own programs
The bill creates a new grant program administered by DPI and available to 
school districts and operators of independent charter schools to reimburse the cost 
of XGrow Your Own Y programs.  Under the bill, Grow Your Own programs include 
high school clubs that encourage careers in teaching, payment of costs associated 
with current staff acquiring education needed for licensure, support for career 
pathways using dual enrollment, support for partnerships focused on attracting or 
developing new teachers, or incentives for paraprofessionals to gain licensure.  The 
bill appropriates $5,000,000 in fiscal year 2026 ]27 for this purpose.
Educators rising; grant
The bill requires DPI to create a competitive request-for-proposal process to 
award a grant to an entity for the purpose of subsidizing cocurricular opportunities 
for public school pupils that encourage those pupils to pursue a career in teaching.  
Under the bill, to be eligible for this grant, an entity must demonstrate to DPI that 
it has successfully supported this type of cocurricular opportunities in public 
schools in this state.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Wisconsin, Inc.  In 2019, Very Special Arts Wisconsin changed its name to Arts for 
All Wisconsin.  The bill updates the appropriation to reflect this name change.
Graduation Alliance
The bill requires the state superintendent of public instruction to annually 
distribute an amount appropriated to DPI to Graduation Alliance, Inc., to support 
pupils and their families through an academic coaching program known as Engage 
Wisconsin.  Currently, DPI partners with Graduation Alliance, Inc., to provide 
Engage Wisconsin to pupils and their families.
Mentor Greater Milwaukee, Inc.
The bill requires DPI to award grants to Mentor Greater Milwaukee, Inc., to 
expand access to quality youth mentoring in Milwaukee County.
The Literacy Lab
The bill requires the state superintendent of public instruction to annually 
distribute an amount appropriated to DPI to The Literacy Lab to provide an 
evidence-based literacy intervention program in public schools located in 
Milwaukee and Racine.
Grants for information technology education
The bill makes several changes to the information technology education grant 
program.  Under current law, DPI must develop a competitive request-for-proposal 
process to award a grant to an entity to provide information technology education 
opportunities to public school pupils in grades 6 to 12, technical college district 
students, and patrons of public libraries.  Currently, to be eligible for the grant, an 
entity must 1) demonstrate that it has successfully offered an information 
technology instructional program in schools in Wisconsin; 2) develop an 
instructional program that includes eight different components specified under 
current law; and 3) ensure that the instructional program will be operated in 225 
sites, including 16 public libraries.  In addition, under current law, DPI must give 
preference in awarding the grant to an entity that demonstrates that it has 
successfully provided high-quality information technology instructional 
programming and educational opportunities to pupils enrolled in or attending 
schools in Wisconsin.
The bill provides that DPI may award the information technology education 
grants to multiple entities.  Under the bill, grants do not need to be awarded 
through a request-for-proposal process, and the grants are for the provision of 
certification opportunities in addition to information technology education.  The bill 
modifies the eligibility criteria for the grants to require grant recipients to develop 
an instructional program that includes at least one of the eight components 
specified under current law and to maximize the number of sites at which the 
instructional program will be operated.  In addition to the current law preference 
requirements, the bill requires DPI to give preference in awarding grants to entities 2025 - 2026  Legislature

Student teacher stipends
The bill provides stipends, through DPI, to student teachers who are 
completing a teacher preparatory program that is approved by the superintendent 
of public instruction.  The stipends are $2,500 per student teacher per semester, 
and begin in the 2026 ]27 school year.  Receipt of a stipend under the bill does not 
preclude an individual from receiving a payment under the Wisconsin Teacher 
Improvement Program, which currently provides stipends to prospective teachers 
in one-semester internships.
Cooperating teacher stipends
The bill provides stipends, through DPI, to teachers who are overseeing a 
student teacher in their classrooms.  The stipends are in the amount of $1,000 per 
teacher per semester and begin in the 2026 ]27 school year.
Fees for licensure of school and public library personnel; appropriation 
changes
Under current law, 90 percent of the fees collected by DPI for licensure of 
school and public library personnel and for school districts [ participation in DPI [s 
teacher improvement program are credited to an annual sum certain appropriation.  
The remaining 10 percent of these fees are deposited into the general fund under 
current law.  The bill changes this annual sum certain appropriation to a 
continuing appropriation and requires that 100 percent of the total fees collected by 
DPI be credited to the appropriation.  An annual sum certain appropriation is 
expendable only up to the amount shown in the schedule and only for the fiscal year 
for which it is made. A continuing appropriation is expendable until fully depleted 
or repealed.
Under current law and the bill, the purposes of the appropriation are for 1) 
DPI[s administrative costs related to licensure of school and public library 
personnel; 2) if DPI exercises its authority to provide information and analysis of 
the professional school personnel supply in this state, the costs of providing that 
information and analysis; and 3) DPI [s teacher improvement program.
GED test fee payments
The bill requires DPI to pay the testing service fee for an eligible individual 
who takes a content area test given under the general educational development 
(GED) test.  The GED test consists of four separate content area tests that cover 
mathematical reasoning and reasoning through language arts, social studies, and 
science.  Under the bill, DPI will pay for an eligible individual to take all four 
content area tests once in each calendar year.
In order to be eligible for the payment, an individual must satisfy DPI [s 
requirements to receive a Certificate of General Educational Development or a 
High School Equivalency Diploma.  Among other things, DPI requires that the 
individual meet certain residency and minimum age requirements and attend a 2025 - 2026  Legislature

grants from the federal government for the farm to school program.  The farm to 
school program promotes the use of locally and regionally grown foods in schools.
Information technology systems; modernization expenses
The bill appropriates GPR to DPI for the purpose of modernizing information 
systems used by DPI.
HIGHER  EDUCATION
Administrative attachment of HEAB and DLAB to DOA
Under current law, the HEAB is an independent agency in the executive 
branch of state government.  HEAB administers most of the state [s higher 
education financial aid programs.
The bill attaches HEAB to DOA for administrative purposes.  Under current 
law, a board that is attached to another agency for administrative purposes is a 
distinct unit of that agency and exercises its powers and duties independently of 
that agency, but performs budgeting, program coordination, and related 
management functions under the direction and supervision of that agency.
Under current law, the Distance Learning Authorization Board (DLAB) is 
administratively attached to HEAB.  DLAB administers the state [s reciprocity 
agreement governing authorization and oversight of higher education institutions 
that provide distance education to out-of-state students.
The bill attaches DLAB for administrative purposes to DOA instead of HEAB.
Nonresident tuition exemption for undocumented individuals and certain 
tribal members enrolled in the UW System or a technical college
The bill creates a nonresident tuition exemptions for certain UW System and 
technical college students.
Current law allows the Board of Regents of the UW System to charge different 
tuition rates to resident and nonresident students.  A person generally must be a 
resident of this state for at least 12 months prior to registering at a UW System 
institution in order to be exempt from paying nonresident tuition.  However, current 
law also includes nonresident tuition exemptions, under which certain nonresident 
students pay resident tuition rates.
Also under current law, the TCS Board establishes program fees that 
technical college districts must charge students.  With exceptions, the fees for 
nonresidents are 150 percent of the fees for residents.  The TCS Board must 
establish procedures to determine the residence of students attending technical 
colleges, but current law specifies that certain students must be considered 
residents of this state.
The bill creates an exemption from nonresident tuition for an individual who 
is not a citizen of the United States and who 1) graduated from a Wisconsin high 2025 - 2026  Legislature

enrolls in a UW System institution and provides the institution with proof stating 
that he or she has filed or will file an application for lawful permanent resident 
status with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as soon as the 
individual is eligible to do so.  The bill also provides that such an individual is 
considered a resident of this state for purposes of admission to and payment of fees 
at a technical college.
The bill also creates a nonresident tuition exemption for certain tribal 
members.  Under the bill, a student enrolled in a UW System institution or 
technical college qualifies for resident tuition or fee rates if all of the following 
apply:
1.  The student is a member of a federally recognized American Indian tribe or 
band in Wisconsin or is a member of a federally recognized tribe in Minnesota, 
Illinois, Iowa, or Michigan.
2.  The student has resided in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, or 
Michigan, or in any combination of these states, for at least 12 months prior to 
enrolling in a UW System institution or technical college.
Tuition and fee remission for certain tribal members and student teachers 
enrolled in the UW System or a technical college
The bill grants full remission of tuition and fees for certain tribal members 
who are UW System or technical college students.  Under the bill, a student is 
exempt from tuition and segregated fees at a UW System institution and from 
tuition and incidental fees at a technical college if the student is a resident of this 
state and an enrolled member of a federally recognized American Indian tribe in 
this state.  The student is eligible for the remission for 128 credits or eight 
semesters, whichever is longer, but only if the student maintains a cumulative 
grade point average of at least 2.0.
The bill also grants full remission of tuition for student teachers enrolled in 
the UW System or a technical college during their semester of student teaching.  
The remission applies for a student who is a resident of this state and is 
participating in the student teaching component of an educator preparatory 
program approved by DPI.

educational loan repayment assistance to recruit and retain faculty for nursing 
programs in institutions of higher education.  Individuals who receive financial 
assistance under the program must make a commitment to teach for at least three 
consecutive years in a nursing program at an institution of higher education.
The bill expands the program to provide the same financial assistance and 
teaching commitment requirement to certain individuals in allied health, 
behavioral health, and dentistry professions, as defined in the bill.
Health care provider loan assistance program
The bill makes five new categories of health care providers eligible for the 
health care provider loan assistance (HCPLA) program and provides additional 
funding for loans to these health care providers.
Under current law, the Board of Regents of the UW System administers the 
HCPLA program under which it may repay, on behalf of a health care provider, up 
to $25,000 in loans for education related to the health care provider [s field of 
practice.  The repayment occurs over three years, with 40 percent of the loan or 
$10,000, whichever is less, repaid in each of the first two years of participation in 
the program and the final 20 percent or $5,000, whichever is less, repaid in the 
third year.  A health care provider is defined as a dental hygienist, dental therapist, 
physician assistant, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner.  The Board of Regents 
must enter into a written agreement with the health care provider in which the 
health care provider agrees to practice at least 32 clinic hours per week for three 
years in one or more eligible practice areas in this state or in a rural area.  An 
Xeligible practice area Y is defined as a free or charitable clinic, a primary care 
shortage area, a mental health shortage area, an American Indian reservation or 
trust lands of an American Indian tribe, or, for a dental hygienist, a dental health 
shortage area or a free or charitable clinic.  Money for loan repayments is derived 
from several sources, and loan repayments are subject to availability of funds.  If 
insufficient funds are available to repay the loans of all eligible applicants, the 
Board of Regents must establish priorities among the eligible applicants based on 
specified considerations, including factors related to the degree of the health care 
need and shortage in the area.  However, some funding for loan repayments is 
available only for health care providers who practice in rural areas.
The bill adds medical assistants, dental assistants, dental auxiliaries, 
behavioral health providers, and substance abuse treatment providers to the health 
care providers who are eligible for loan repayment under the HCPLA program.  
These health care providers are eligible under the current terms of the program, 
except medical assistants.  Medical assistants are eligible for loan repayment of up 
to $12,500 in total, with repayments of 40 percent of the loan or $5,000, whichever 
is less, in each of the first two years and 20 percent or $2,500, whichever is less, in 
the third year.  For purposes of an eligible practice area, dental assistants, dental 2025 - 2026  Legislature

Expanding the rural dentistry scholarship program
Under current law, HEAB in consultation with DHS administers a 
scholarship program for students enrolled in the Marquette University School of 
Dentistry (MUSD) who agree to practice dentistry in a dental health shortage area 
for 18 months for each annual scholarship received.  A Xdental health shortage 
areaY is an area that is federally designated as having a shortage of dental 
professionals, not including Brown, Dane, Kenosha, Milwaukee, and Waukesha 
Counties.  From the program, HEAB may award to no more than 15 MUSD 
students an annual scholarship of $30,000 per year for up to four years.  A student 
who fails to meet their obligation to practice in a dental health shortage area for the 
requisite period must repay the amount of scholarship received.
The bill expands the scholarship program to include dental general practice 
residents as possible recipients of the scholarship, in addition to any student 
enrolled in the MUSD.
Parkinson [s disease registry
The bill directs the Population Health Institute (PHI), or its successor, at the 
UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health to establish and maintain a 
Parkinson [s disease registry and to collect data on the incidence and prevalence of 
Parkinson [s disease and parkinsonisms in this state.  The bill defines 
Xparkinsonism Y as a condition that is similar or related to Parkinson [s disease.
In addition, under the bill, if a health care provider treats or diagnoses a 
patient with Parkinson [s disease or a parkinsonism, that health care provider or 
the health care facility that employs or contracts with the health care provider must 
report information about the patient [s Parkinson [s disease or parkinsonism to PHI 
for purposes of the Parkinson [s disease registry.  If a patient declines to participate 
in the Parkinson [s disease registry, the health care provider or health care facility 
must report only the incident of the patient [s Parkinson [s disease or parkinsonism.
The bill directs PHI to create a website for the Parkinson [s disease registry 
that includes annual reports on the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson [s disease 
in this state.  The bill also authorizes UW-Madison to enter into agreements in 
order to furnish data from the Parkinson [s disease registry to another state [s 
Parkinson [s disease registry, a federal Parkinson [s disease control agency, a local 
health officer, or a researcher who proposes to conduct research on Parkinson [s 
disease, subject to certain confidentiality requirements.  In addition, the bill 
requires the UW System to allocate from its general program operations 
appropriation $3,900,000 in fiscal year 2025 ]26 and $2,400,000 in fiscal year 
2026]27 to establish the statewide Parkinson [s disease registry.
UW System funding allocations and grant to the Institute for Healthy Aging

biennium, to the Institute for Healthy Aging to support programs in fall prevention 
and recovery training.
UW Missing-in-Action Recovery and Identification Project
Under the bill, the Board of Regents of the UW System must provide funding 
to the UW Missing-in-Action Recovery and Identification Project (MIA Recovery 
Project) for missions to recover and identify Wisconsin veterans who are missing in 
action.  At the conclusion of the mission for which funding is provided, the MIA 
Recovery Project must submit to the Board of Regents, JCF, each legislative 
standing committee dealing with veterans matters, the governor, DVA, and DMA a

ELECTIONS
Automatic voter registration
The bill requires the Elections Commission to use all feasible means to 
facilitate the registration of all individuals eligible to vote in this state and to 
maintain the registration of all registered voters for so long as they remain eligible.  
Under the bill, the commission must attempt to facilitate the initial registration of 
all eligible individuals as soon as practicable.  To facilitate that initial registration, 
the bill directs the commission and DOT to enter into an agreement so that DOT 
may transfer specified personally identifying information in DOT [s records to the 
commission.  The bill requires the commission to maintain the confidentiality of 
any information it obtains under the agreement and allows a driver [s license or 
identification card applicant to opt out of DOT [s transfer of this information to the 
commission.
Once the commission obtains all the information required under current law 
to complete an eligible individual [s registration, the commission adds the 
individual [s name to the statewide registration list.  The bill also permits an 
individual whose name is added to the registration list or who wishes to 
permanently exclude his or her name from the list to file a request to have his or her 
name deleted or excluded from the list or to revoke a deletion or exclusion request 
previously made.  In addition, the bill directs the commission to notify an individual

individuals under the bill.  The report must contain an assessment of the feasibility 
and desirability of integration of registration information with information 
maintained by DHS, DCF, DWD, DOR, DSPS, and DNR; the UW System; and the 
TCS Board, as well as with the technical colleges in each technical college district.
Under current law, an eligible individual with a current and valid driver [s 
license or identification card issued by DOT may register to vote electronically on a 
secure website maintained by the commission.  To register electronically under 
current law, an eligible individual must also authorize DOT to forward a copy of his 
or her electronic signature to the commission.  The authorization affirms that all 
information provided by the individual is correct and has the same effect as a 
written signature on a paper copy of the registration form.  Finally, current law 
requires the commission and DOT to enter into an agreement that permits the 
commission to verify the necessary registration information instantly by accessing 
DOT[s electronic files.
Early canvassing of absentee ballots
Under current law, absentee ballots may not be canvassed until election day.  
The bill authorizes a municipal clerk or municipal board of election commissioners 
to begin the canvassing of absentee ballots on the day before an election, subject to 
the following requirements:
1.  The municipality must use automatic tabulating equipment to process 
absentee ballots.
2.  Prior to the early canvassing of absentee ballots, the municipal clerk or 
municipal board of election commissioners must notify the Elections Commission in 
writing and must consult with the Elections Commission concerning 
administration of early canvassing of absentee ballots.
3.  Early canvassing of absentee ballots under the bill may be conducted only 
between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on the day before the election, and ballots may not be 
tallied until after polls close on election day.
4.  Members of the public must have the same right of access to a place where 
absentee ballots are being canvassed early as is provided under current law for 
canvassing absentee ballots on election day.
5.  When not in use, automatic tabulating equipment used for canvassing 
absentee ballots and the areas where the programmed media and the absentee 
ballots are housed must be secured with tamper-evident security seals in a double-
lock location such as a locked cabinet inside a locked office.
6.  Subject to criminal penalty, no person may act in any manner that would 
give him or her the ability to know or to provide information on the accumulating or 
final results from the ballots canvassed early under the bill before the close of the 
polls on election day.
7.  Certain notices must be provided before each election at which the 
municipality intends to canvass absentee ballots on the day before the election.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 48 - LRB-2080/1

Residency requirement for voting
Under current law, with limited exceptions, an otherwise eligible voter must 
be a resident of Wisconsin and of the municipality and ward, if any, where the voter 
is voting for 28 days before an election in order to vote in the election in that 
municipality and ward.  The bill shortens that residency requirement from 28 days 
to 10 days.
Voting absentee in person
Current law allows an individual to complete an absentee ballot in person no 
earlier than 14 days preceding the election and no later than the Sunday preceding 
the election.  The bill eliminates the 14-day restriction on how soon a person may 
complete an absentee ballot in person.
Voter bill of rights
The bill creates a voter bill of rights that municipal clerks and boards of 
election commissioners must post at each polling place.  The bill of rights informs 
voters that they have the right to do all of the following:
1.  Vote if registered and eligible to vote.
2.  Inspect a sample ballot before voting.
3.  Cast a ballot if in line when the polling place closes or, if voting by in-person 
absentee ballot on the last day for which such voting is allowed, when the municipal 
clerk[s office closes.
4.  Cast a secret ballot.
5.  Get help casting a ballot if disabled.
6.  Get help voting in a language other than English as provided by law.
7.  Get a new ballot, up to three ballots in all, if the voter makes a mistake on 
the ballot.
8.  Cast a provisional ballot as provided by law.
9.  Have the voter [s ballot counted accurately.
10.  Vote free from coercion or intimidation.
11.  Report any illegal or fraudulent election activity.
Office of Election Transparency and Compliance
The bill creates under the Elections Commission the Office of Election 
Transparency and Compliance.  The office is under the direction and supervision of 
a director who must be a policy initiatives advisor appointed in the classified 
service by the Elections Commission administrator.
The bill requires the office, as directed by the commission by resolution, to 
perform research and assist the commission [s legal staff in presenting information 
to the members of the commission concerning sworn complaints of election law 
violations, including allegations that a person provided false or misleading 
information to an election official during the registration or voting process, and 
sworn complaints alleging noncompliance with election laws and processes by 
election officials.  The bill further requires the office to provide assistance and 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 49 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
research to the commission with respect to the following, as directed by the 
commission administrator:
1.  Procedures at polling places.
2.  Election processes.
3.  Election systems and equipment, including with respect to accessibility 
requirements for individuals with disabilities.
4.  Responding to public records requests.
5.  Responding to legislative inquiries and requests for assistance.
6.  Responding to inquiries from the public.
Voter registration in high schools
Prior to 2011 Wisconsin Act 240, state law required that all public high schools 
be used for voter registration for enrolled students and members of the high school 
staff.  Prior law also authorized voter registration to take place at a private high 
school or a tribal school that operates high school grades if requested by the 
principal.  The bill reinstates those provisions.
Under the bill, the municipal clerk must notify the school board of each school 
district in which the municipality is located that high schools will be used for voter 
registration.  The school board and the clerk must then appoint at least one 
qualified voter at each high school to be a special school registration deputy.  The 
bill allows students and staff to register at the school on any day that classes are 
regularly held.  The deputies promptly forward the registration forms to the clerk 
and the clerk adds qualified voters to the registration list.  The clerk may reject a 
registration form, but the clerk must notify the registrant and inform the registrant 
of the reason for being rejected.  Under the bill, a form completed by an individual 
who will be 18 years of age before the next election and who is otherwise qualified to 
vote must be filed in such a way that the individual is automatically registered to 
vote when the individual is 18.
Finally, the bill allows a principal of a private high school or tribal school that 
operates high school grades to request that the municipal clerk appoint a qualified 
voter at the school to be a special school registration deputy.  Under the bill, the 
clerk must appoint a special school registration deputy if the clerk determines that 
the private high school or tribal school has a substantial number of students 
residing in the municipality.
Proof of identification for voting
Current law allows an individual to use as voter identification an unexpired 
identification card issued by a technical college, college, or university in this state if 
the card meets certain criteria.  The card must have an expiration date that is no 
later than two years after the date it was issued, and the individual must establish 
proof of enrollment.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit held that the 
requirement to present both an unexpired identification card and proof of 
enrollment had no rational basis and was therefore unconstitutional.  See Luft v. 
Evers , 963 F.3d 665 (2020).  The bill allows a student to use an expired student 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 50 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
identification card under certain circumstances.  Under the bill, a student does not 
need to present proof of enrollment if using an unexpired identification card but 
must provide proof of enrollment if using an expired identification card.  In 
addition, the bill requires each technical college in this state and each UW System 
institution to issue student identification cards that meet the criteria to be used as 
voter identification.
Current law also allows an individual to use as voter identification an 
identification card issued by DOT.  DOT may issue a receipt as a temporary 
identification card to use for voting and other purposes to an individual who is 
waiting for the permanent card.  The receipt expires in 60 days.  The bill extends 
the expiration date to 180 days.
Petitions to complete a partial recount
Under current law, any candidate voted for at an election who is an aggrieved 
party may petition for a full or partial recount of the votes cast in the jurisdiction or 
district of the office that the candidate seeks.  Current law defines an Xaggrieved 
partyY as any of the following:
1.  For an election at which 4,000 or fewer votes are cast for the office that the 
candidate seeks, a candidate who trails the leading candidate by no more than 40 
votes.
2.  For an election at which more than 4,000 votes are cast for the office that 
the candidate seeks, a candidate who trails the leading candidate by no more than 
1 percent of the total votes cast for that office.
If a candidate who is an aggrieved party petitions for a partial recount, 
current law provides that the opposing candidate may file a petition for an 
additional partial or a full recount of the wards or municipalities not subject to the 
initial partial recount no later than 5 p.m. two days after the initial partial recount 
is completed.
Under the bill, a candidate must be an aggrieved party in order to petition for 
an additional partial or a full recount after an initial partial recount is completed.  
Therefore, if, after an initial partial recount, the opposing candidate becomes an 
aggrieved party—i.e., the leading candidate becomes the trailing candidate—that 
opposing candidate may file a petition for an additional partial or a full recount.  
However, the bill excludes from that authorization to petition for an additional 
partial or full recount the candidate who filed the petition for the initial partial 
recount.
Special elections to fill vacancies in the office of U.S. senator and 
representative in congress
Under current law, a vacancy in the office of U.S. senator or representative in 
congress occurring prior to the second Tuesday in April in the year of the general 
election must be filled at a special primary and special election.  A vacancy 
occurring in one of these offices between the second Tuesday in April and the 
second Tuesday in May in the year of the general election is filled at the partisan 
primary and general election.
Current law provides that a special primary be held four weeks before the day 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 51 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
of the special election.  However, if the election is held on the same day as the spring 
election, the special primary is held concurrently with the spring primary.  Under 
current law, with regard to an election for a national office, the period between a 
special primary and special election or between the spring primary or spring 
election does not provide sufficient time to canvass and certify the primary results 
and prepare ballots to send to overseas voters as required by federal law.
Under the bill, a vacancy in the office of U.S. senator or representative in 
congress is filled in the following manner:
1.  At a special election to be held on the third Tuesday in May following the 
first day of the vacancy with a special primary to be held concurrently with the 
spring primary on the third Tuesday in February.
2.  At a special election to be held on the second Tuesday in August following 
the first day of the vacancy with a special primary to be held on the third Tuesday 
in May.
3.  At a special election to be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in 
November following the first day of the vacancy with a special primary to be held on 
the second Tuesday in August.
However, under the bill, a November special election is not held in any year in 
which the general election is held for that office; instead, the vacancy is filled at the 
partisan primary and general election.
Election administration grants
The bill requires the Elections Commission to award grants to cities, villages, 
and towns for election administration expenses.  The bill additionally requires the 
commission to award up to $400,000 in grants to cities, villages, towns, and 
counties in the 2025 ]26 fiscal year for the purchase of election supplies and 
equipment, including electronic poll books.
Reimbursement of counties and municipalities for certain election costs
The bill requires the Elections Commission to reimburse counties and 
municipalities for certain costs incurred in the administration of special primaries 
and special elections for state or national office.  A cost is eligible for reimbursement 
only if certain conditions are met, including that the commission determines the 
cost is reasonable and the rate paid by the county or municipality for the cost does 
not exceed the rate customarily paid for similar costs at a primary or election that is 
not a special primary or election.  Under the bill, only the following costs may be 
reimbursed:
1.  Rental payments for polling places.
2.  Election day wages paid to election officials working at the polls.
3.  Costs for the publication of required election notices.
4.  Printing and postage costs for absentee ballots and envelopes.
5.  Costs for the design and printing of ballots and poll books.
6.  Purchase of ballot bags or containers, including ties or seals for chain of 
custody purposes.2025 - 2026  Legislature

7.  Costs to program electronic voting machines.
8.  Purchase of memory devices for electronic voting machines.
9.  Wages paid to conduct a county canvass.
10.  Data entry costs for the statewide voter registration system.
Posting sample ballots in non-English languages
Under the bill, if any jurisdiction in the state provides voting materials in one 
or more languages other than English, the Elections Commission must post on its 
website the sample ballots for that jurisdiction in each such language.
Appropriation for clerk training
Current law appropriates money annually from the general fund to the 
Elections Commission for training county and municipal clerks concerning voter 
identification requirements. The bill expands this appropriation to authorize 
expenditures for training county and municipal clerks for the administration of 
elections generally.
Recount fees
Current law requires the Elections Commission to reimburse the counties for 
the actual costs of conducting a recount.  The reimbursement comes from the fees 
that the commission collects from the person that filed the recount petition.  The 
bill changes the appropriation for reimbursing the counties from an annual 
appropriation to a continuing appropriation.
EMPLOYMENT
EMPLOYMENT  REGULATION
Collective bargaining for state and local employees; employee rights
Under current law, state and local governments are prohibited from 
collectively bargaining with employees except as expressly provided in the statutes.  
Current law allows certain protective occupation participants under the Wisconsin 
Retirement System, known as public safety employees, and certain municipal 
transit employees to collectively bargain over wages, hours, and conditions of 
employment.  Under current law, other state and municipal employees may 
collectively bargain only over a percentage increase in base wages that does not 
exceed the percentage increase in the consumer price index.  In addition, under 
current law, the Employment Relations Commission (ERC) assigns employees to 
collective bargaining units, but current law requires that public safety employees 
and municipal transit employees be placed in separate collective bargaining units 
that do not contain other state or municipal employees.
The bill adds frontline workers to the groups that may collectively bargain 
over wages, hours, and conditions of employment.  In the bill, Xfrontline workers Y 
are state or municipal employees with regular job duties that include interacting 
with members of the public or with large populations of people or that directly 
involve the maintenance of public works.  Under the bill, the ERC determines which 
state and municipal employees meet the criteria.  Also, the bill allows the ERC to 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 53 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
place in the same collective bargaining unit both frontline workers and employees 
who are not frontline workers.  If the ERC places employees of both types in a 
collective bargaining unit, the entire collective bargaining unit is treated as if all 
members are frontline workers and all members may collectively bargain over 
wages, hours, and conditions of employment.
Under current law, state or municipal employees in a collective bargaining 
unit elect their representative.  The representative for a unit containing public 
safety employees or transit employees requires the support of the majority of the 
employees who are voting in the election, and the representative for a unit 
containing other employees requires the support of the majority of all of the 
employees who are in the collective bargaining unit.  Under the bill, the 
representative for any collective bargaining unit containing any state or municipal 
employees requires the support of the majority of the employees who are voting in 
the election regardless of the number of employees who are in the collective 
bargaining unit.
Under current law, the ERC must conduct an annual election to certify each 
representative of a collective bargaining unit representing state or municipal 
employees who are not public safety employees or transit employees.  At the 
election, if a representative fails to receive at least 51 percent of the votes of all of 
the members of the collective bargaining unit, the representative is decertified and 
the employees are unrepresented.  The bill eliminates this annual recertification 
process.
The bill requires state and municipal employers to consult about wages, hours, 
and conditions of employment with their employees who are not public safety 
employees, transit employees, or frontline workers.  The employers must consult 
either when policy changes that affect wages, hours, or conditions are proposed or 
implemented or, in the absence of policy changes, at least quarterly.
The bill adds that employees of authorities, such as the UW Hospitals and 
Clinics Authority, WHEDA, and WEDC, may collectively bargain as state 
employees, and adds faculty and academic staff employed by the UW System, 
including those assigned to UW-Madison, to the state employees who may 
collectively bargain.
Eliminating the right-to-work law
The current right-to-work law prohibits a person from requiring, as a 
condition of obtaining or continuing employment, an individual to refrain or resign 
from membership in a labor organization, to become or remain a member of a labor 
organization, to pay dues or other charges to a labor organization, or to pay any 
other person an amount that is in place of dues or charges required of members of a 
labor organization.  The bill eliminates these prohibitions and the associated 
misdemeanor offense for violating the right-to-work law.
The bill explicitly provides that, when an all-union agreement is in effect, it is 
not an unfair labor practice to encourage or discourage membership in a labor 
organization or to deduct labor organization dues or assessments from an 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 54 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
employee [s earnings.  The bill sets conditions under which an employer may enter 
into an all-union agreement.  The bill also sets conditions for the continuation or 
termination of all-union agreements, including that, if the Wisconsin Employment 
Relations Commission (WERC) determines there is reasonable ground to believe 
employees in an all-union agreement have changed their attitude about the 
agreement, WERC must conduct a referendum to determine whether the employees 
wish to continue the agreement.  WERC must terminate an all-union agreement if 
it finds the union unreasonably refused to admit an employee into the union.
Prevailing wage
The bill requires that laborers, workers, mechanics, and truck drivers 
employed on the site of certain projects of public works be paid the prevailing wage 
and not be required or allowed to work a greater number of hours per day and per 
week than the prevailing hours of labor unless they are paid overtime for all hours 
worked in excess of the prevailing hours of labor.  Projects subject to the bill include 
state and local projects of public works, including state highway projects, with 
exceptions including projects below certain cost thresholds, minor service or 
maintenance work, and certain residential projects.  Under the bill, Xprevailing 
wage rate Y is defined as the hourly basic rate of pay, plus the hourly contribution for 
bona fide economic benefits, paid for a majority of the hours worked in a trade or 
occupation in the area in which the project is located, except that, if there is no rate 
at which a majority of those hours is paid, Xprevailing wage rate Y means the 
average hourly basic rate of pay, plus the average hourly contribution for bona fide 
economic benefits, paid for the highest-paid 51 percent of hours worked in a trade or 
occupation in the area.  XPrevailing hours of labor Y is defined as 10 hours per day 
and 40 hours per week, excluding weekends and holidays.  The bill requires DWD to 
conduct investigations and hold public hearings as necessary to define the trades or 
occupations that are commonly employed on projects that are subject to the 
prevailing wage law and to inform itself of the prevailing wage rates in all areas of 
the state for those trades or occupations, in order to determine the prevailing wage 
rate for each trade or occupation.  The bill contains certain other provisions 
regarding the calculation of prevailing wage rates by DWD, including provisions 
allowing persons to request recalculations or reviews of the prevailing wage rates 
determined by DWD.
The bill requires contracts and notices for bids for projects subject to the bill to 
include and incorporate provisions ensuring compliance with the requirements.  
The bill also establishes a requirement that state agencies and local governments 
post prevailing wage rates and hours of labor in areas readily accessible to persons 
employed on the project or in sites regularly used for posting notices.
The bill makes a contractor that fails to pay the prevailing wage rate or 
overtime pay to an employee as required under the prevailing wage law liable to the 
affected employee for not only the amount of unpaid wages and overtime pay, but 
also for liquidated damages in an amount equal to 100 percent of the unpaid wages 
and overtime pay.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 55 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
Finally, the bill includes, for both state and local projects of public works, 
provisions regarding coverage, compliance, enforcement, and penalties, including 1) 
requirements for affidavits to be filed by contractors affirming compliance with the 
prevailing wage law; 2) record retention requirements for contractors regarding 
wages paid to workers and provisions allowing for the inspection of those records by 
DWD; 3) liability and penalty provisions for certain violations, including criminal 
penalties; and 4) provisions prohibiting contracts from being awarded to persons 
who have failed to comply with the prevailing wage law.
Family and medical leave expansion
Under the current family and medical leave law, an employer that employs at 
least 50 individuals on a permanent basis must allow an employee who has been 
employed by the employer for more than 52 consecutive weeks and who has worked 
for the employer for at least 1,000 hours during the preceding 52 weeks to take 
family leave to care for the employee [s child, spouse, domestic partner, or parent 
who has a serious health condition.  Employers covered under the law must also 
allow an employee covered under the law to take up to two weeks of medical leave in 
a 12-month period when that employee has a serious health condition.  An employee 
may file a complaint with DWD regarding an alleged violation of the family and 
medical leave law within 30 days after either the violation occurs or the employee 
should reasonably have known that the violation occurred, whichever is later.
The bill makes the following changes to the family and medical leave law:
1.  Requires employers covered under the law to allow employees covered 
under the law to take family leave to provide for a grandparent, grandchild, or 
sibling who has a serious health condition.
2.  Decreases the number of hours an employee is required to work before 
qualifying for family and medical leave to 680 hours during the preceding 52 weeks.
3.  Extends the time period in which an employee may file a complaint with 
DWD to 300 days after either the violation occurs or the employee should 
reasonably have known that the violation occurred, whichever is later.
4.  Removes the age restriction from the definition of XchildY for various 
purposes under the family and medical leave law.
5.  Requires employers to allow employees to take family leave in the instance 
of an unforeseen or unexpected gap in childcare for an employee [s child, grandchild, 
or sibling or because of a qualifying exigency as to be determined by DWD related to 
covered active duty, as defined in the bill, or notification of an impending call or 
order to covered active duty of an employee [s child, spouse, domestic partner, 
parent, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling who is a member of the U.S. armed 
forces.
6.  Requires employers to allow employees to take family leave to address 
issues related to the employee or the employee [s child, spouse, domestic partner, 
parent, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling being the victim of domestic abuse, 
sexual abuse, or stalking.
7.  Requires employers to allow employees to take family leave to care for a 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 56 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling of an 
employee who is in medical isolation and requires employers to allow employees to 
take medical leave when an employee is in medical isolation.  The bill defines 
Xmedical isolation Y to include when a local health officer or DHS advises that an 
individual isolate or quarantine; when a health care professional, a local health 
officer, or DHS advises that an individual seclude herself or himself when awaiting 
the results of a diagnostic test for a communicable disease or when the individual is 
infected with a communicable disease; and when an individual [s employer advises 
that the individual not come to the workplace due to a concern that the individual 
may have been exposed to or infected with a communicable disease.
Paid family and medical leave benefits
The bill requires employers that are covered by the current family and medical 
leave law to provide paid benefits to their employees for up to eight weeks of family 
and medical leave annually, beginning on January 1, 2027.  The bill exempts most 
state employers from required coverage.  Under the bill, an employer may buy 
private insurance to pay benefits to employees.  Employers are prohibited from 
deducting any cost of the insurance from an employee [s paycheck or otherwise 
seeking reimbursement for the cost of providing the leave benefits.
Under the bill, the amount of leave benefits for a week for which benefits are 
payable is as follows:  1) for the amount of the employee's average weekly earnings 
that are not more than 50 percent of the state annual median wage in the calendar 
year before the employee [s application year, 90 percent of that individual's average 
weekly earnings; or 2) for the amount of the employee [s average weekly earnings 
that are more than 50 percent of the state annual median wage in the calendar year 
before the employee [s application year, 50 percent of that employee [s average weekly 
earnings.
The bill also provides an employee with the right to appeal a final decision of 
an employer or an insurer to deny a leave benefit.
Minimum wage
The bill requires the secretary of workforce development to establish a 
committee to study options to achieve a minimum wage that ensures all workers in 
this state earn a living wage.  Under the bill, the committee consists of nine 
members, with five appointed by the governor, and one each appointed by the 
speaker of the assembly, the assembly minority leader, the senate majority leader, 
and the senate minority leader.  The committee must submit a report containing its 
recommendations for options to achieve a minimum wage and other means to 
ensure that all workers in this state earn a living wage to the governor and the 
appropriate standing committees of the legislature no later than October 1, 2026.
Employee right to request and receive work schedule changes
The bill requires an employer to negotiate in good faith with an employee to 
accommodate changes the employee requests to his or her work schedule.  Further, 
the bill requires that unless an employer has a bona fide business reason for 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 57 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
denying the request, the employer must approve an employee [s request if it is 
directly related to any of the following:
1. A serious health condition of the employee.
2. Responsibilities of the employee as a caregiver for a family member.
3. Enrollment of the employee in certain educational or training programs.
4. A part-time employee [s work scheduling conflicts with the employee [s other 
employment.
If an employer denies an employee [s request for a schedule change, the 
employer must inform the employee of the reasons for denial, including whether any 
of the reasons is a bona fide business reason as defined in the bill.
Service employee right to predictable work schedule
The bill requires an employer that employs an employee in certain service 
industry occupations, including retail, food service, and cleaning occupations, to 
provide the service employee with a written copy of the employee [s work schedule 
on or before the service employee [s first day of work.  With certain exceptions, if an 
employer changes the service employee [s work schedule, the employer must provide 
the new work schedule to the employee at least 14 days in advance.
The bill also requires that, if an employer changes a service employee [s work 
schedule with fewer than 14 days [ notice, the employer must pay the service 
employee an amount equal to the employee [s regular rate of pay for one hour of 
work.  Exceptions to this requirement include when the employee consents to the 
change or when the employer requires the service employee to work additional time 
because another employee was scheduled to work that time and is unexpectedly 
unavailable to work.
The bill also requires the following for employers that use certain scheduling 
practices:
1.  If the service employee reports to work and the employer does not allow the 
employee to work all time scheduled, the employer must provide the employee with 
a) full compensation as if the employee had worked the full shift or b) if the 
employee is scheduled to work more than four hours and works less than four hours, 
an amount equal to the employee [s regular rate of pay for the difference between 
four hours and the amount of time the employee actually works.
2.  If the employer requires the service employee to contact the employer, or 
wait to be contacted by the employer less than 24 hours before a work shift to 
determine whether the employee must report to work, the employer must pay the 
employee an amount equal to the employee [s regular rate of pay for one hour of 
work.
3.  If the employer requires the service employee to work a split shift, the 
employer must pay the employee an amount equal to the employee [s regular rate of 
pay for one hour of work.
If a service employee experiences more than one type of these scheduling 
practices with respect to a particular work shift, the employer must pay only one 
type of compensation, whichever is greatest.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 58 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
The bill also provides that, during any period in which the employer [s regular 
operations are suspended due to an event outside of the employer [s control, the 
employer is not required to comply with the service employee work scheduling 
requirements created in the bill.
Enforcement of rights regarding work schedules
The bill provides that an employer may not interfere with, restrain, or deny 
the exercise of the right of an employee to request and receive work schedule 
changes and the right of certain service employees to a predictable work schedule, 
and may not discharge or discriminate against such an employee for enforcing the 
employee [s rights under the bill.  An employee whose rights are violated may file a 
complaint with DWD, and DWD must process the complaint in the same manner 
that employment discrimination complaints are processed under current law.  That 
processing may include the ordering of back pay, reinstatement, compensation in 
lieu of reinstatement, and costs and attorney fees.
The bill also provides that DWD or an employee whose rights are violated may 
bring an action in circuit court against the employer without regard to exhaustion 
of any administrative remedy.  If the circuit court finds that a violation has 
occurred, the employer may be liable to the employee for compensatory damages, 
reasonable attorney fees and costs, and, under certain circumstances, liquidated 
damages equal to 100 percent of the amount of compensatory damages awarded to 
the employee.  In addition to any damages imposed on an employer in an 
administrative proceeding or circuit court action, an employer that willfully violates 
the protections created in the bill may be required to forfeit not more than $1,000 
for each violation.
Liquidated damages in wage claim actions
Under current law, if an employee files a claim in circuit court for unpaid 
wages, the court may award liquidated damages to the employee in addition to past 
due wages.  Under current law, the liquidated damages are as follows: 1) if an 
employee files the suit before DWD has finished its investigation and attempted to 
settle the claim, a court may award not more than 50 percent of the wages due and 
unpaid and 2) if an employee files the suit after DWD has completed its 
investigation of a wage claim, a court may award not more than 100 percent of the 
wages due and unpaid.  Under the bill, irrespective of whether DWD has completed 
its investigation of a wage claim, an employee is presumed to be entitled to 100 
percent of the wages due and unpaid in liquidated damages in addition to the 
unpaid wages due.  An employer may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that 
they acted in good faith and had a reasonable belief that they were in compliance 
with the law.
Compensation in job posting
Under the bill, an employer must include the compensation for the position in 
any job posting made by the employer.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Local employment regulations
The bill eliminates the preemptions of local governments from enacting or 
enforcing ordinances related to the following:
1.  Regulations related to wage claims and collections.
2.  Regulation of employee hours and overtime, including scheduling of 
employee work hours or shifts.
3.  The employment benefits an employer may be required to provide to its 
employees.
4.  An employer [s right to solicit information regarding the salary history of 
prospective employees.
5.  Regulations related to minimum wage.
6.  Occupational licensing requirements that are more stringent than a state 
requirement.  See  Local Government.
Certain state and local employment regulations
The bill eliminates the following:
1.  The prohibition of the state and local governments from requiring any 
person to waive the person [s rights under state or federal labor laws as a condition 
of any approval by the state or local government.
2.  A provision under which neither the state nor a local government may 
enact a statute or ordinance, adopt a policy or regulation, or impose a contract, 
zoning, permitting, or licensing requirement, or any other condition, that would 
require any person to accept any provision that is a subject of collective bargaining 
under state labor laws or the federal National Labor Relations Act.
Worker classification notice and posting
Current law requires DWD to perform certain duties related to worker 
classification, including for purposes of promoting and achieving compliance by 
employers with state employment laws.  The bill requires DWD to design and make 
available to employers a notice regarding worker classification laws, requirements 
for employers and employees, and penalties for noncompliance.  Under the bill, all 
employers in this state must post the notice in a conspicuous place where notices to 
employees are customarily posted.  Finally, the bill provides a penalty of not more 
than $100 for an employer who does not post the notice as required.
WORKER[S COMPENSATION
Expansion of PTSD coverage for first responders
The bill makes changes to the conditions of liability for worker [s compensation 
benefits for emergency medical responders, emergency medical services 
practitioners, volunteer firefighters, correctional officers, emergency dispatchers, 
coroners and coroner staff members, and medical examiners and medical examiner 
staff members (collectively, Xfirst responders Y), who are diagnosed with post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Under current law, if a law enforcement officer or full-time firefighter is 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 60 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
diagnosed with PTSD by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist and the mental 
injury that resulted in that diagnosis is not accompanied by a physical injury, that 
law enforcement officer or firefighter can bring a claim for worker [s compensation 
benefits if the conditions of liability are proven by the preponderance of the evidence 
and the mental injury is not the result of a good faith employment action by the 
person[s employer.  Also under current law, liability for such treatment for a mental 
injury is limited to no more than 32 weeks after the injury is first reported.
Under current law, an injured first responder who does not have an 
accompanying physical injury must, in order to receive worker [s compensation 
benefits for PTSD, demonstrate a diagnosis based on unusual stress of greater 
dimensions than the day-to-day emotional strain and tension experienced by all 
employees as required under School District No. 1 v. DILHR , 62 Wis. 2d 370, 215 
N.W.2d 373 (1974).  Under the bill, such an injured first responder is not required to 
demonstrate a diagnosis based on that standard, and instead must demonstrate a 
diagnosis based on the same standard as law enforcement officers and firefighters.  
Also, under the bill, a first responder is restricted to compensation for a mental 
injury that is not accompanied by a physical injury and that results in a diagnosis of 
PTSD three times in his or her lifetime irrespective of a change of employer or 
employment, in the same manner as law enforcement officers and firefighters.
Worker[s compensation; penalties for uninsured employers
Under current law, an employer who requires an employee to pay for any part 
of worker [s compensation insurance or who fails to provide mandatory worker [s 
compensation insurance coverage is subject to a forfeiture.  If the employer violates 
those requirements, for the first 10 days, the penalty under current law is not less 
than $100 and not more than $1,000 for such a violation.  If the employer violates 
those requirements for more than 10 days, the penalty under current law is not less 
than $10 and not more than $100 for each day of such a violation.
Under the bill, the forfeitures for an employer who requires an employee to pay 
for worker [s compensation coverage or fails to provide the coverage (violation) are as 
follows:
1.  For a first violation, $1,000 per violation or the amount of the insurance 
premium that would have been payable, whichever is greater.
2.  For a second violation, $2,000 per violation or two times the amount of the 
insurance premium that would have been payable, whichever is greater.
3.  For a third violation, $3,000 per violation or three times the amount of the 
insurance premium that would have been payable, whichever is greater.
4.  For a fourth or subsequent violation, $4,000 per violation or four times the 
amount of the insurance premium that would have been payable, whichever is 
greater.
Under current law, if an employer who is required to provide worker [s 
compensation insurance coverage provides false information about the coverage to 
his or her employees or contractors who request information about the coverage, or 
fails to notify a person who contracts with the employer that the coverage has been 2025 - 2026  Legislature

canceled in relation to the contract, the employer is subject to a forfeiture of not less 
than $100 and not more than $1,000 for each such violation.
Under the bill, the penalty for a first or second such violation remains as 
specified under current law, the penalty for a third violation is $3,000, and the 
penalty for a fourth or subsequent violation is $4,000.
Currently, an uninsured employer must pay to DWD an amount that is equal 
to the greater of the following: 1) twice the amount that the uninsured employer 
would have paid for worker [s compensation coverage during periods in which the 
employer was uninsured in the preceding three years or 2) $750 or, if certain 
conditions apply, $100 per day.
The bill provides that the amounts an uninsured employer must pay to DWD 
for a determination of a failure to carry worker [s compensation insurance are as 
follows:
1.  For a first or second determination, the amounts specified in current law.
2.  For a third determination, the greater of the following: a) three times the 
amount that the uninsured employer would have paid for worker [s compensation 
coverage during periods in which the employer was uninsured in the preceding 
three years or b) $3,000.
3.  For a fourth or subsequent determination, the greater of the following: a) 
four times the amount that the uninsured employer would have paid for worker [s 
compensation coverage during periods in which the employer was uninsured in the 
preceding three years or b) $4,000.
False or fraudulent worker [s compensation insurance applications
Current law specifies criminal penalties for various types of insurance fraud, 
which are punishable as either a Class A misdemeanor or a Class I felony, 
depending on the value of the claim or benefit.  The bill adds to the list of criminally 
punishable insurance fraud the following:  1) the presentation of false or fraudulent 
applications for worker [s compensation insurance coverage and 2) the presentation 
of applications for worker [s compensation insurance coverage that falsely or 
fraudulently misclassify employees in order to lower premiums.
Also under current law, if an insurer or self-insured employer has evidence 
that a worker [s compensation claim is false or fraudulent, the insurer or self-
insured employer must generally report the claim to DWD.  If, on the basis of the 
investigation, DWD has a reasonable basis to believe that criminal insurance fraud 
has occurred, DWD must refer the matter to the district attorney for prosecution.  
DWD may request assistance from DOJ to investigate false or fraudulent activity 
related to a worker [s compensation claim.  If, on the basis of that investigation, 
DWD has a reasonable basis to believe that theft, forgery, fraud, or any other 
criminal violation has occurred, DWD must refer the matter to the district attorney 
or DOJ for prosecution.  The bill extends these requirements to insurers that have 
evidence that an application for worker [s compensation insurance coverage is 
fraudulent or that an employer has committed fraud by misclassifying employees to 
lower the employer [s worker [s compensation insurance premiums.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Worker[s compensation; substantial fault
Currently, under the worker [s compensation law, an employer is not liable for 
temporary disability benefits during an employee [s healing period if the employee is 
suspended or terminated from employment due to misconduct by the employee 
connected with the employee [s work.  Current law defines Xmisconduct Y by 
reference to the unemployment insurance (UI) law.  The bill changes the definition 
of Xmisconduct Y under the UI law, which change also applies for purposes of the 
worker[s compensation law as described above.
Reimbursements for supplemental worker [s compensation benefits
Under current law, worker [s compensation insurers must pay supplemental 
benefits to certain employees who were permanently disabled by an injury that is 
compensable under worker [s compensation.
DWD is authorized to collect up to $5,000,000 from insurers that provide 
worker[s compensation insurance to provide those supplemental benefits. This 
money must be used exclusively to provide reimbursements to insurers that pay 
those supplemental benefits and that request reimbursements.  The bill creates a 
new, separate appropriation in the worker [s compensation operations fund, to be 
used exclusively to provide these reimbursements.  The bill does not increase 
revenue to DWD or collections from insurers.
UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE
Unemployment insurance; worker misclassification penalties
Current law requires DWD to assess an administrative penalty against an 
employer engaged in construction projects or in the painting or drywall finishing of 
buildings or other structures who knowingly and intentionally provides false 
information to DWD for the purpose of misclassifying or attempting to misclassify 
an individual who is an employee of the employer as a nonemployee under the UI 
law.  The penalty under current law is $500 for each employee who is misclassified, 
not to exceed $7,500 per incident.  In addition, current law provides for criminal 
fines of up to $25,000 for employers who, after having previously been assessed 
such an administrative penalty, commit another violation.  Current law 
additionally requires DWD to assess an administrative penalty against such an 
employer who, through coercion, requires an employee to adopt the status of a 
nonemployee; the penalty amount is $1,000 for each employee so coerced, but not to 
exceed $10,000 per calendar year.  Penalties are deposited into the unemployment 
program integrity fund.
The bill does the following:  1) removes the $7,500 and $10,000 limitations on 
the administrative penalties and provides that the penalties double for each act 
occurring after the date of the first determination of a violation; 2) removes the 
limitations on the types of employers to whom the prohibitions apply, making them 
applicable to any type of employer; and 3) specifies that DWD may make referrals 
for criminal prosecution for alleged criminal misclassification violations regardless 2025 - 2026  Legislature

the UI law.
Increasing maximum weekly benefits
Under current law, a person who qualifies for UI receives a weekly benefit rate 
equal to a percentage of that person [s past earnings, but the weekly benefit rate is 
capped at $370.  The bill changes the maximum weekly benefit rate in the following 
ways:
1.  For benefits paid for weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 
4, 2026, but before January 3, 2027, the maximum weekly benefit rate is capped at 
$497.
2.  For benefits paid for weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 
3, 2027, the maximum weekly benefit rate is increased based upon the change in 
the consumer price index and is then increased on the same basis annually 
thereafter.
Increasing benefit wage cap
Under current law, a person who qualifies for UI is ineligible to receive any UI 
benefits for a week if the person receives or will receive wages or certain other 
earnings totalling more than $500 (wage cap).  The bill changes the wage cap in the 
following ways:
1.  For weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 4, 2026, but 
before January 3, 2027, the wage cap is increased to $672.
2.  For weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 3, 2027, the 
wage cap is increased based upon the change in the consumer price index and is 
then increased on the same basis annually thereafter.
Substantial fault
Under current law, a claimant for UI benefits whose work is terminated by his 
or her employer for substantial fault by the claimant connected with the claimant [s 
work is ineligible to receive UI benefits until the claimant satisfies certain 
requalification criteria.  With certain exceptions, current law defines Xsubstantial 
faultY to include those acts or omissions of a claimant over which the claimant 
exercised reasonable control and that violate reasonable requirements of the 
claimant [s employer.  The bill eliminates this provision on substantial fault.
Misconduct
Under current law, a claimant for UI benefits whose work is terminated by his 
or her employer for misconduct by the claimant connected with the claimant [s work 
is ineligible to receive UI benefits until the claimant satisfies certain requalification 
criteria, and the claimant [s wages paid by the employer that terminates the 
claimant for misconduct are excluded for purposes of calculating benefit 
entitlement.  Current law defines Xmisconduct Y using a general, common law 
standard derived from Boynton Cab Co. v. Neubeck , 237 Wis. 249 (1941), and 
enumerates several specific types of conduct that also constitute misconduct.  
Under one of these specific provisions, misconduct includes 1) absenteeism on more 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 64 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
than two occasions within the 120-day period before the date of the claimant [s 
termination, unless otherwise specified by his or her employer in an employment 
manual of which the claimant has acknowledged receipt with his or her signature, 
or 2) excessive tardiness by a claimant in violation of a policy of the employer that 
has been communicated to the claimant.  In Department of Workforce Development 
v. Labor and Industry Review Commission (Beres) , 2018 WI 77, the supreme court 
held that an employer could, under the language described above, institute an 
attendance policy more restrictive than two occasions within the 120-day period.
Current law also provides that absenteeism or tardiness count as misconduct 
only if the claimant did not provide to his or her employer both notice and one or 
more valid reasons for the absenteeism or tardiness.  In Bevco Precision 
Manufacturing v. Labor and Industry Review Commission , 2024 WI App. 54, the 
court of appeals held that under Beres , this qualifying language did not apply if an 
employer had adopted its own standard on absenteeism and tardiness, as described 
above.
The bill does all of the following:
1.  Eliminates the language referencing Xexcessive tardiness. Y
2.  Reverses the holding in Bevco  by providing that a claimant [s notice and 
reason for an occasion of absenteeism or tardiness are to be analyzed under the 
common law misconduct standard.  Under the bill, therefore, an employer may not 
establish its own policy for determining the reasonableness of absenteeism or 
tardiness.  The bill does not, however, affect the general ability of an employer to 
institute a standard for absenteeism and tardiness more restrictive than two 
occasions within the 120-day period before termination.
3.  Clarifies, in another provision defining misconduct, that Xtribal 
government Y has the meaning given under state and federal law for what is 
considered an Indian tribe.
Drug testing
Current state law requires DWD to establish a program to test certain 
claimants who apply for UI benefits for the presence of controlled substances in a 
manner that is consistent with federal law.  A claimant who tests positive for a 
controlled substance for which the claimant does not have a prescription is 
ineligible for UI benefits until certain requalification criteria are satisfied or unless 
he or she enrolls in a substance abuse treatment program and undergoes a job skills 
assessment, and a claimant who declines to submit to a test is simply ineligible for 
benefits until he or she requalifies.  The bill eliminates the requirement to establish 
the drug testing program.
Also under current law, an employer may voluntarily submit to DWD the 
results of a preemployment test for the presence of controlled substances that was 
conducted on an individual as a condition of an offer of employment or notify DWD 
that an individual declined to submit to such a test.  If DWD then verifies that 
submission, the employee may be ineligible for UI benefits until he or she 
requalifies.  However, a claimant who tested positive may maintain eligibility by 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 65 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
enrolling in a substance abuse treatment program and undergoing a job skills 
assessment.  The bill eliminates these preemployment drug testing provisions.
Acceptance of suitable work
Under current law, if a claimant for UI benefits fails, without good cause, to 
accept suitable work when offered, the claimant is ineligible to receive benefits until 
he or she earns wages after the week in which the failure occurs equal to at least six 
times the claimant [s weekly UI benefit rate in covered employment.  Current law 
specifies what is considered Xsuitable work Y for purposes of these provisions, with 
different standards applying depending on whether six weeks have elapsed since 
the claimant became unemployed.  Once six weeks have elapsed since the claimant 
became unemployed, the claimant is required to accept work that pays lower and 
involves a lower grade of skill.
The bill modifies these provisions described above so that the claimant is not 
required to accept less favorable work until 10 weeks  have elapsed since the 
claimant became unemployed.
Quits due to nonsuitable work
Under current law, unless an exception applies, if a claimant for UI benefits 
quits his or her job, the claimant is generally ineligible to receive UI benefits until 
he or she qualifies through subsequent employment.  Under one such exception, if a 
claimant quits his or her job and 1) the claimant accepted work that was not 
suitable work under the UI law or work that the claimant could have refused, and 2) 
the claimant terminated the work within 30 calendar days after starting the work, 
the claimant remains eligible to collect UI benefits.  Under the bill, this exemption 
applies if the claimant terminated that work within 10 weeks after starting the 
work.
Waiting period
Currently, a claimant must wait one week after becoming eligible to receive UI 
benefits before the claimant may receive benefits for a week of unemployment, 
except for periods during which the waiting period is suspended.  The waiting 
period does not affect the maximum number of weeks of a claimant [s benefit 
eligibility.
The bill deletes the one-week waiting period, thus permitting a claimant to 
receive UI benefits beginning with his or her first week of eligibility.
Work search and registration
Under current law, a claimant for UI benefits is generally required to register 
for work and to conduct a work search for each week in order to remain eligible.  
Current law requires DWD to waive these requirements under certain 
circumstances, for example, if a claimant who is laid off from work reasonably 
expects to be recalled to work within 12 weeks, will start a new job within four 
weeks, routinely obtains work through a labor union referral, or is participating in 
a training or work share program.  Under current law, DWD may modify the 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 66 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
statutory waivers or establish additional waivers by rule only if doing so is required 
or specifically allowed by federal law.
The bill removes the waiver requirements from statute and instead allows 
DWD to establish waivers for the registration for work and work search 
requirements by rule.  DWD may establish a waiver by emergency rule if the 
secretary of workforce development determines that the waiver is needed only on a 
temporary basis or that permanent rules are not warranted, and the bill allows the 
secretary to extend the emergency rule for up to 60 days at a time.  Also, the bill 
specifies that the work search requirement does not apply to a claimant who has 
been laid off but DWD determines that the claimant has a reasonable expectation to 
be recalled to work.
Social security disability insurance payments
Under current law, in any week in any month that a claimant is issued a 
benefit under the federal Social Security Disability Insurance program (SSDI 
payment), that claimant is ineligible for UI benefits. The bill eliminates that 
prohibition and instead requires DWD to reduce a claimant [s UI benefit payments 
by the amount of SSDI payments.  The bill requires DWD to allocate a monthly 
SSDI payment by allocating to each week the fraction of the payment attributable 
to that week.
Quits due to relocations
Under current law, unless an exception applies, if an individual quits his or 
her job, the individual is generally ineligible to receive UI benefits until he or she 
qualifies through subsequent employment.
Under one such exception, if the employee [s spouse is a member of the U.S. 
armed forces on active duty and is relocated, and the employee quits his or her job in 
order to relocate with his or her spouse, the employee remains eligible to collect UI 
benefits.  The bill expands this exception so that it applies to an employee who quits 
employment in order to relocate with a spouse who is required by any employer, not 
just the U.S. armed forces, to relocate.
Electronic communications
Currently, with certain exceptions, each employer that has employees who are 
engaged in employment covered by the UI law must file quarterly contribution (tax) 
and employment and wage reports and make quarterly contribution payments to 
DWD.  An employer of 25 or more employees or an employer agent that files reports 
on behalf of any employer must file its reports electronically.  Current law also 
requires each employer that makes contributions for any 12-month period ending 
on June 30 equal to a total of at least $10,000 to make all contribution payments 
electronically in the following year.  Finally, current law allows DWD to provide a 
secure means of electronic interchange between itself and employing units, 
claimants, and other persons that, upon request to and with prior approval by 
DWD, may be used for transmission or receipt of any document specified by DWD 2025 - 2026  Legislature

that is related to the administration of the UI law in lieu of any other means of 
submission or receipt.
The bill makes use of these electronic methods mandatory in all cases unless 
the employer or other person demonstrates good cause for being unable to use the 
electronic method.  The bill specifies what constitutes good cause for purposes of 
these provisions.  The bill also makes various corresponding changes to penalty 
provisions that apply in the case of nonuse of these required electronic methods.  
The bill further provides that DWD may permit the use of electronic records and 
electronic signatures for any document specified by DWD that is related to the 
administration of the UI law.
JOBS AND JOB TRAINING
Wisconsin Fast Forward grants
Under current law, DWD awards grants under what is commonly known as 
the Wisconsin Fast Forward program, for various workforce training purposes.  The 
bill adds grants for education and training in the use of artificial intelligence to the 
allowed uses of funds under the program and requires DWD to collaborate with 
DHS and DPI in administering the program.  The bill also requires DWD to allocate 
moneys under the Wisconsin Fast Forward program as follows:
1.  A total of $2,000,000 in GPR funding in fiscal year 2025 ]26 for green jobs 
training.
2.  A total of $200,000 in GPR funding in each year of the 2025 ]27 fiscal 
biennium for grants to help school districts to prepare students for a future that 
includes artificial intelligence.
3. A total of $1,000,000 in GPR funding in each year of the 2025 ]27 fiscal 
biennium to provide grants to support costs of sponsoring teacher apprentices.
4.  A total of $500,000 in GPR funding in each year of the 2025 ]27 fiscal 
biennium to support training in the health care industry.
Youth to registered apprentice grant program
The bill requires DWD to develop and administer a grant program to award 
grants to local youth apprenticeship consortia to encourage individuals who are 
enrolled in youth apprenticeship programs to continue their careers in registered 
apprenticeship programs.  The bill limits grants to no more than $350,000 in any 
fiscal year.
On-the-job learning grant program
The bill requires DWD to develop and administer a grant program to award 
grants to employers for costs related to apprenticeship programs, specifically wages 
for apprentices and costs for mentoring and instruction.  Eligible employers are 
healthcare employers under a pilot program and small or new employers that have 
never had an apprenticeship program or have not had an apprenticeship program 
in the particular trade, craft, or business for which the employer seeks the grant in 
the five years before applying for the grant.

must allocate $15,000,000 for grants for workforce development in the area of 
artificial intelligence and $25,000,000 for grants for health care workforce 
development.
Teacher apprenticeships
DWD is currently operating a teacher apprenticeship pilot program, under 
which an individual serving as a teacher apprentice earns an associate degree and 
a bachelor [s degree that satisfy requirements for a license to teach issued by DPI 
while the individual earns money as a teacher apprentice.  The bill requires DWD 
to, in consultation with DPI, prescribe the conditions under which an individual 
may serve as a teacher apprentice and to prescribe what an individual must do to 
demonstrate that the individual has successfully completed a teacher 
apprenticeship.  See  Education .
Wisconsin worker advancement program
The bill requires DWD to establish and maintain the Wisconsin worker 
advancement program to make grants to local organizations for the organizations to 
provide employment and workforce services.
DISCRIMINATION
Civil actions regarding employment discrimination, unfair honesty, and 
unfair genetic testing
Under current fair employment law, an individual who alleges that an 
employer has violated employment discrimination, unfair honesty testing, or unfair 
genetic testing laws may file a complaint with DWD seeking action that will 
effectuate the purpose of the fair employment law, including reinstating the 
individual, providing back pay, and paying costs and attorney fees.
The bill allows DWD or an individual who is alleged or was found to have been 
discriminated against or subjected to unfair honesty or genetic testing to bring an 
action in circuit court to recover compensatory and punitive damages caused by the 
act of discrimination, unfair honesty testing, or unfair genetic testing, in addition to 
or in lieu of filing an administrative complaint.  The action in circuit court must be 
commenced within 300 days after the alleged discrimination, unfair honesty 
testing, or unfair genetic testing occurred.  The bill does not allow such an action for 
damages to be brought against a local governmental unit or against an employer 
that employs fewer than 15 individuals.
Under the bill, if the circuit court finds that a defendant has committed 
employment discrimination, unfair honesty testing, or unfair genetic testing, the 
circuit court may award back pay and any other relief that could have been awarded 
in an administrative proceeding.  In addition, the circuit court must order the 
defendant to pay to the individual found to have been discriminated against or 
found to have received unfair genetic testing or unfair honesty testing 
compensatory and punitive damages in the amount that the circuit court finds 2025 - 2026  Legislature

2.  If the defendant employs more than 100 but fewer than 201 employees, no 
more than $100,000.
3.  If the defendant employs more than 200 but fewer than 501 employees, no 
more than $200,000.
4.  If the defendant employs more than 500 employees, no more than $300,000.
The bill requires DWD to annually revise these amounts on the basis of the 
change in the consumer price index in the previous year, if any positive change has 
occurred.
Employment discrimination based on conviction record
The bill provides that it is employment discrimination for a prospective 
employer to request conviction information from a job applicant before the applicant 
has been selected for an interview.
The bill, however, does not prohibit an employer from notifying job applicants 
that an individual with a particular conviction record may be disqualified by law or 
the employer [s policies from employment in particular positions.
Employment discrimination based on gender expression and gender 
identity
Current law prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of a person [s 
sex or sexual orientation.  The bill prohibits employers from discriminating against 
an employee on the basis of the employee [s gender identity or gender expression.  
Gender expression is defined in the bill as an individual [s actual or perceived 
gender-related appearance, behavior, or expression, regardless of whether these 
traits are stereotypically associated with the individual [s assigned sex at birth.  
Gender identity is defined in the bill an individual [s internal understanding of the 
individual [s gender, or the individual [s perceived gender identity.
ADMINISTRATION  AND FINANCE
Worker[s compensation; appropriations
Under current law, the costs of DWD [s administration of the worker [s 
compensation program is generally funded by a general worker [s compensation 
operations appropriation under the worker [s compensation operations fund.  
However, the worker [s compensation uninsured employers program and certain 
other worker [s compensation activities are instead funded by a separate 
appropriation from the worker [s compensation operations fund.  The bill does the 
following:
1.  Eliminates the separate appropriation and instead funds the worker [s 
compensation uninsured employers program and those other activities from the 
general appropriation.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 70 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
2.  Changes the general appropriation for worker [s compensation from a sum 
certain to a sum sufficient appropriation.
Elimination of automatic transfer 
Under current law, administration of the worker [s compensation program is 
funded from a DWD appropriation from the worker [s compensation operations fund.  
The Labor Industry and Review Commission (LIRC) decides appeals of worker [s 
compensation decisions for DWD.  Under current law, moneys are automatically 
transferred from the DWD appropriation to a LIRC appropriation account to pay for 
those hearing activities.  The bill eliminates this automatic transfer of moneys to 
the LIRC appropriation account.  The bill retains the LIRC appropriation, but 
funds it directly from the worker [s compensation operations fund, in an amount set 
in the appropriation schedule in ch. 20, stats.  With this change, any money 
remaining in the LIRC appropriation at the end of a fiscal year will lapse to the 
worker[s compensation operations fund.
Wisconsin Fast forward training appropriation
The bill changes from an annual appropriation to a continuing appropriation 
an appropriation for training programs, grants, services, and contracts that are 
part of DWD [s Wisconsin Fast Forward program.
Youth apprenticeship appropriation change
Under current law, DWD may award grants to local partnerships for youth 
apprenticeship programs.  The grant program is funded through a sum certain 
appropriation.  The bill changes that appropriation to a sum sufficient 
appropriation.
Migrant labor camp facilities
The bill excludes from the definition of Xmigrant labor camp Y bed and 
breakfasts, hotels, and rooming houses that are required to be licensed by DATCP.
Migrant labor contractors and migrant labor camps
Under current law, migrant labor contractors are required to have a certificate 
of registration from DWD, which the contractor must renew annually.  To receive 
the certificate, the contractor must provide an application, which must be 
accompanied by a fee.  Also under current law, a person that maintains a migrant 
labor camp is required to have a certificate from DWD to operate the camp, which 
the person must renew annually.  To receive the certificate, the operator of the camp 
must provide an application, which must be accompanied by a fee.  Current law 
requires that these fees be deposited in the state general fund and not credited to a 
specific appropriation.  The bill instead requires that the fees be credited to the 
DWD auxiliary services appropriation and authorizes that appropriation to be used 
for administrative costs related to the migrant labor program administered by 
DWD.2025 - 2026  Legislature

ENVIRONMENT
PFAS
The bill contains several provisions relating to perfluoroalkyl and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).
Spills law exemptions and requirements for PFAS
Under current law provisions known as the Xspills law, Y a person that 
possesses or controls a hazardous substance or that causes the discharge of a 
hazardous substance must notify DNR immediately, restore the environment to the 
extent practicable, and minimize the harmful effects from the discharge.  If action 
is not being adequately taken, or the identity of the person responsible for the 
discharge is unknown, DNR may take emergency action to contain or remove the 
hazardous substance; the person that possessed or controlled the hazardous 
substance that was discharged or that caused the discharge of the hazardous 
substance must then reimburse DNR for expenses DNR incurred in taking such 
emergency actions.  The spills law allows DNR to enter property to take emergency 
action if entry is necessary to prevent increased environmental damages, and to 
inspect any record relating to a hazardous substance for the purpose of determining 
compliance with the spills law.  DNR may also require that preventive measures be 
taken by any person possessing or having control over a hazardous substance if 
existing control measures are inadequate to prevent discharges.
The bill exempts a person who possesses or controls property where a PFAS 
discharge occurred from all of the requirements, if all of the following apply:
1.  The property is exclusively used for agricultural use or residential use.
2.  The discharge was caused by land application of sludge according to a water 
pollutant discharge elimination system (WPDES) permit.
3.  The person who possesses or controls the property allows DNR, any 
responsible party, and any consultant or contractor of a responsible party to enter 
the property to take action to respond to the discharge.
4.  The person who possesses or controls the property does not interfere with 
any action taken in response to the discharge and does not take any action that 
worsens or contributes to the PFAS discharge.
5.  The person who possesses or controls the property follows any other 
condition that DNR determines is reasonable and necessary to ensure that DNR, 
the responsible party, or any consultant or contractor of the responsible party is 
able to adequately respond to the discharge, including taking action necessary to 
protect human health, safety, or welfare or the environment, taking into 
consideration the current or intended use of the property.
6.  The person who possesses or controls the property allows DNR to limit 
public access to the property if DNR determines it is necessary to prevent an 
imminent threat to human health, safety, or welfare or to the environment.
Under the bill, this exemption applies only to PFAS for which there is a state 
or federal standard, a public health recommendation from DHS, or a health 
advisory issue by the federal Environmental Protection Agency.  The exemption 
also does not apply after December 31, 2035.  The exemption does not apply to any 2025 - 2026  Legislature

ALL:all
substances other than PFAS, and does not apply if the person that possesses or 
controls the property takes action that worsens or contributes to the PFAS 
discharge.
The bill requires a person that is exempt from these provisions to provide 
written disclosure of the type and location of the PFAS contamination and 
remediation activities to any prospective purchaser or tenant of the property.  The 
bill also provides that the exemption may not be transferred to subsequent owners 
of the property; each person that possesses or controls the property must establish 
eligibility for the exemption.
 The bill also provides that DNR may not use the fact that a person has applied 
for financial assistance under the state [s well compensation program, the county 
well testing grant program created in the bill, or any other state grant programs 
funded by the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to determine whether the 
person is a person that possesses or controls a hazardous substance or that causes 
the discharge of a hazardous substance for purposes of applying the spills law.
Finally, the bill provides that, if there is no existing standard for a hazardous 
substance, the person that possesses or controls the hazardous substance or that 
caused the discharge of the hazardous substance must propose site-specific 
environmental standards for DNR approval.
Groundwater standards for PFAS
Under current law, DNR maintains a list of substances that have a reasonable 
probability of entering the groundwater resources of the state and that are shown to 
involve public health concerns.  DHS recommends groundwater enforcement 
standards for substances on this list, which DNR then proposes as DNR rules in its 
rule-making process.  The bill requires DNR to begin the rule-making process to 
adopt DHS [s recommended groundwater enforcement standards for any PFAS 
within three months after receiving DHS [s recommendation.
Rule-making exemptions for PFAS
Current law requires an agency to suspend working on a permanent rule if it 
determines that the proposed rule may result in more than $10,000,000 in 
implementation and compliance costs over any two-year period.  Current law also 
allows standing committees of the legislature and the Joint Committee for the 
Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) to review, approve, object to, or modify a 
proposed rule.  If JCRAR objects to all or part of a proposed rule, that rule may not 
be promulgated unless a bill is introduced and enacted that authorizes the 
promulgation of the rule.  In addition, current law allows JCRAR to suspend rules 
that have already been promulgated; if the rule suspended is an emergency rule, 
the agency that promulgated the emergency rule is prohibited from proposing a 
permanent rule that contains the same substance as the suspended emergency 
rule.  The bill creates an exemption from these provisions for any proposed or 
existing DNR rule that establishes acceptable levels and standards, enforcement 
standards and preventative action limits, performance standards, monitoring 2025 - 2026  Legislature

requirements, or required response actions for any PFAS compound or group or 
class of PFAS in groundwater, drinking water, surface water, air, soil, or sediment.
PFAS community grant program
The bill creates a community grant program, administered by DNR, to 
address PFAS.  Under the program, DNR must provide grants to cities, towns, 
villages, counties, tribal governments, utility districts, lake protections districts, 
sewerage districts, and municipal airports (municipalities).  DNR may award a 
grant only if the applicant tested or trained with a PFAS-containing firefighting 
foam in accordance with applicable state and federal law, or a third party tested or 
trained with PFAS-containing firefighting foam within the boundaries of the 
municipality; the applicant applied biosolids to land under a WPDES permit issued 
by DNR; PFAS are impacting the applicant [s drinking water supply or surface 
water or groundwater within the municipality and the responsible party is 
unknown or is unwilling or unable to take the necessary response actions; or PFAS 
contamination in groundwater is impacting private wells within the area controlled 
by the municipality.
Under the bill, grants provided under this program may be used to investigate 
potential PFAS impacts in order to reduce or eliminate environmental 
contamination; treat or dispose of PFAS-containing firefighting foam containers; 
sample a private water supply within three miles of a site or facility known to 
contain PFAS or to have caused a PFAS discharge; assist private well owners with 
the cost of installation of filters, treatment, or well replacement; provide a 
temporary emergency water supply, a water treatment system, or bulk water to 
replace water contaminated with PFAS; conduct emergency, interim, or remedial 
actions to mitigate, treat, dispose of, or remove PFAS contamination; remove or 
treat PFAS in public water systems in areas where PFAS levels exceed the 
maximum contaminant level for PFAS in drinking water or an enforcement 
standard for PFAS groundwater or in areas where the state has issued a health 
advisory for PFAS; create a new public water system or connect private well owners 
to an existing public water system in areas with widespread PFAS contamination in 
private wells; or sample and test water in schools and daycares for PFAS 
contamination.
An applicant that receives a grant under this program must contribute 
matching funds equal to at least 20 percent of the amount of the grant.  The 
applicant must apply for a grant on a form prescribed by DNR and must include any 
information that DNR finds is necessary to determine the eligibility of the project, 
identify the funding requested, determine the priority of the project, and calculate 
the amount of a grant.  In awarding grants under this program, DNR must consider 
the applicant [s demonstrated commitment to performing and completing eligible 
activities, including the applicant [s financial commitment and ability to 
successfully administer grants; the degree to which the project will have a positive 
impact on public health and the environment; and any other criteria that DNR 
finds necessary to prioritize the funds available for awarding grants.2025 - 2026  Legislature

ALL:all
County PFAS well testing grant program
The bill also creates a grant program, under which DNR provides grants to 
counties to provide sampling and testing services to private well owners to sample 
and test for PFAS, nitrates, bacteria, and lead.  The bill creates an appropriation to 
be funded from the segregated PFAS fund for this purpose.
PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Loan Program
Under current law, DOA and DNR administer the Safe Drinking Water Loan 
Program (SDWLP), which provides financial assistance from the environmental 
improvement program to municipalities, and to the private owners of community 
water systems that serve municipalities, for projects that will help the municipality 
comply with federal drinking water standards.  DNR establishes a funding priority 
list for SDWLP projects, and DOA allocates funding for those projects.
The bill requires DNR, when ranking the priority of SDWLP projects, to rank 
a project relating to PFAS in the same manner as if a maximum contaminant level 
for PFAS had been attained or exceeded, if DHS has recommended an enforcement 
standard for the type of PFAS involved in the project.
Mediator for municipalities seeking alternate water sources due to PFAS
Under the bill, if a municipality [s private water supplies have been 
contaminated by PFAS and the municipality is seeking an alternate water supply 
from another municipality, DNR may appoint a mediator to assist in negotiations 
between the two municipalities.  Under the bill, this provision only applies if the 
contaminating PFAS is in excess of a state or federal drinking water standard, a 
state groundwater standard, or a public health recommendation from DHS.  The 
bill provides that the person responsible for the contamination may participate in 
the negotiations.  The bill requires DNR to promulgate rules to implement these 
provisions, including rules for the allocation of the cost of a mediator.
Landspreading and PFAS
Under current law, a wastewater treatment facility, and any person that 
wishes to land spread sludge, must obtain a WPDES permit from DNR.  DNR is 
required to include conditions in such permits to ensure compliance with water 
quality standards.
Under the bill, a WPDES permit that allows the permittee to land spread 
sludge must also include a condition that requires the permittee to annually test 
the sludge for any type of PFAS for which there is a state or federal standard, a 
public health recommendation from DHS, or a health advisory from the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency.  The permittee must report the sampling and 
testing results to DNR and to the property owner before applying the sludge.
Additionally, a WPDES permit issued to a treatment work must require the 
permittee to test all sludge for the presence of PFAS and to report the testing 
results to DNR.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 75 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
Proof of financial responsibility for PFAS contamination
The bill also provides that DNR may, if it determines doing so is necessary to 
protect human health or the environment, require a person who possesses or 
controls or who causes the discharge of PFAS, or who manufactures products that 
contain intentionally added PFAS, to provide proof of financial responsibility for 
remediation and long-term care to address contamination by a potential discharge 
of PFAS or environmental pollution that may be caused by a discharge of PFAS.  
This financial responsibility requirement does not apply to a person that is exempt 
from the spills law under the provisions of the bill.
Environmental justice impacts of PFAS transportation and disposal
The bill requires a person disposing of PFAS, or transporting PFAS for the 
purpose of disposal, to attempt to the greatest extent possible to avoid disposing of 
PFAS in, or transporting PFAS to, any location where such disposal or 
transportation will contribute to environmental justice concerns and to consider all 
reasonable alternatives for transport and disposal of PFAS.  The bill requires DNR 
to assist in evaluating the environmental justice impacts of a person [s PFAS 
disposal or transportation.
Statewide PFAS biomonitoring studies
The bill requires DHS to conduct biomonitoring studies across the state to 
assess PFAS exposure levels and better understand the factors that affect PFAS 
levels in residents of different communities.  As part of these studies, DHS may 
survey volunteer participants, test blood samples for PFAS, and analyze the results.
DATCP testing for PFAS
Under current law, DATCP conducts several statewide monitoring programs, 
sampling programs, and surveys related to testing groundwater quality for 
agricultural purposes.  The bill requires that, when collecting and testing samples 
under one of these statewide programs, DATCP must also, at its discretion and 
where appropriate, test samples for the presence of PFAS.
HAZARDOUS  SUBSTANCES  AND ENVIRONMENTAL  CLEANUP
Revitalize Wisconsin program
The bill creates the Revitalize Wisconsin program, which is administered by 
DNR and which provides aid, in the form of grants or direct services to local 
governments, dry cleaners, and private parties, to address the discharge of a 
hazardous substance or the existence of environmental pollution on the 
government [s or person [s property.  Aid may be provided for sites for which the 
site[s owner or operator applied for assistance under the dry cleaner environmental 
response program before the bill [s effective date; brownfields; sites that are exempt 
from the state [s spills law; and sites that are subject to the spills law but that are 
owned by private parties.  The bill defines Xprivate party Y to mean a bank, trust 
company, savings bank, or credit union; a developer; a nongovernmental 
organization; or an innocent landowner.  The bill defines an Xinnocent landowner Y 2025 - 2026  Legislature

as a property owner that either 1) acquired the property prior to November 1, 2006, 
has continuously owned the property since the date of acquisition, and can 
demonstrate, through documentation, that the discharge or environmental 
pollution being addressed was caused by another person and that the property 
owner did not know and had no reason to know of the discharge or pollution when 
the owner acquired the property or 2) acquired the property on or after November 1, 
2006, meets all of the previously stated requirements, and can demonstrate, 
through documentation, that the property owner conducted all appropriate 
inquiries in compliance with federal law prior to acquiring the property.
The bill provides that DNR may not award aid to an applicant under the 
Revitalize Wisconsin program if the applicant caused the discharge or 
environmental pollution, unless the applicant is a dry cleaner that applied for 
assistance under the dry cleaner environmental response program before the bill [s 
effective date.  The bill also provides that DNR may require an applicant to provide 
a match, either in cash or in-kind services, for any aid that is awarded under the 
program.
Activities for which aid may be provided under the program include removing 
hazardous substances from contaminated media; investigating and assessing the 
discharge or environmental pollution; removing abandoned containers; asbestos 
abatement; and restoring or replacing a private potable water supply.
The bill also allows DNR to inspect any document in the possession of an 
applicant or any other person if the document is relevant to an application for 
financial assistance under the program.
Access to information on solid or hazardous waste
Under current law, a person who generated, transported, treated, stored, or 
disposed of solid or hazardous waste at a site or facility under investigation by DNR 
must provide DNR with access to certain records relating to that waste.  The bill 
requires a person who generated solid or hazardous waste at a site or facility under 
investigation by DNR to also provide this information, if the waste was transported 
to, treated at, stored at, or disposed of at another site, facility, or location.
Kewaunee Marsh remediation funding
The bill appropriates moneys from the general fund to DNR for development of 
a remedial action plan and for the remediation of arsenic contamination in the 
Kewaunee Marsh in Kewaunee County.
Amcast superfund site remediation funding
The bill appropriates moneys from the segregated environmental fund to DNR 
for remedial action relating to the Amcast superfund site in Cedarburg.  A 
Xsuperfund site Y is a site identified under the federal Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) as being 
contaminated with hazardous substances and requiring cleanup.

WATER  QUALITY
Well compensation grant program
The bill makes changes to the well compensation grant program currently 
administered by DNR.
Under current law, an individual owner or renter of a contaminated private 
well may apply for a grant from DNR to cover a portion of the costs to treat the 
water, reconstruct the well, construct a new well, connect to a public water supply, 
or fill and seal the well.  To be eligible for a grant, the well owner [s or renter [s 
annual family income may not exceed $65,000.  A grant awarded under the program 
may not cover any portion of a project [s eligible costs in excess of $16,000 and, of 
those costs, may not exceed 75 percent of a project [s eligible costs, meaning that a 
grant may not exceed $12,000.  In addition, if the well owner [s or renter [s annual 
family income exceeds $45,000, the amount of the award is reduced by 30 percent of 
the amount by which the annual family income exceeds $45,000.
The bill increases the family income limit to $100,000.  In addition, under the 
bill, a well owner or renter whose family income is below the state [s median income 
may receive a grant of up to 100 percent of a project [s eligible costs, not to exceed 
$16,000.  The bill also eliminates the requirement to reduce an award by 30 percent 
if the well owner [s or renter [s family income exceeds $45,000.
The bill also expands the grant program to allow an owner or renter of a 
Xtransient noncommunity water supply Y to apply for a grant.  A Xtransient 
noncommunity water supply Y is defined in the bill as a water system that serves at 
least 25 persons at least 60 days of the year but that does not regularly serve at least 
25 of the same persons over six months per year.
Under current law, a well that is contaminated only by nitrates is eligible for a 
grant only if the well is a water supply for livestock, is used at least three months in 
each year, and contains nitrates in excess of 40 parts per million.  The bill 
eliminates these restrictions for claims based on nitrates, and instead allows grants 
to be issued for wells based on contamination by at least 10 parts per million of 
nitrate nitrogen.  The bill also allows grants to be issued for wells contaminated by 
at least 10 parts per billion of arsenic, or by a perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl 
substance (PFAS) in an amount that exceeds any applicable health advisory or 
standard for that substance.
Under current law, DNR must issue grants in the order in which completed 
claims are received.  Under the bill, if there are insufficient funds to pay claims, 
DNR may, for claims based on nitrate contamination, prioritize claims that are 
based on higher levels of nitrate contamination.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Town of Bloom well compensation grant eligibility
Under current law, a city, village, town, county, or special purpose district is 
not eligible for a grant under the well compensation grant program.  The bill 
provides that the town of Bloom in Richland County may apply for this type of 
grant, but the grant may not exceed $16,000.
Ballast water discharge
Under current law, DNR may issue a general permit authorizing a vessel that 
is 79 feet or greater in length to discharge ballast water into the waters of the state. 
DNR may charge an application fee of $1,200 and a $345 annual fee for the permit.  
DNR must use collected fees to administer the permit program.
The bill eliminates these provisions and provides that the owner or operator of 
any commercial vessel subject to the requirements of the federal Vessel Incidental 
Discharge Act that has operated outside this state must pay DNR $650 per arrival 
to a port of this state.  Under the bill, the owner or operator of a commercial vessel 
subject to these requirements, including a vessel engaged in coastwise trade, may 
not be required to pay more than $3,250 in fees per calendar year.  DNR must use 
collected fees for management, administration, inspection, monitoring, and 
enforcement activities relating to incidental discharges, including ballast water 
discharges.
Under current law, an employee or agent of DNR may board and inspect any 
vessel that is subject to requirements relating to environmental protection 
requirements for tank vessels or open burning on commercial vessels to determine 
compliance with those requirements.
The bill provides that DNR may enter into a memorandum of agreement with 
the U.S. Coast Guard authorizing an employee or agent of DNR to board and 
inspect any vessel that is subject to the requirements under the bill to determine 
compliance with the federal Vessel Incidental Discharge Act.
Storm water pond safety
Under current law, DNR issues water pollutant discharge elimination system 
(WPDES) permits and storm water discharge permits and promulgates rules for 
the administration of both permits. The bill requires that DNR promulgate rules 
establishing that any pond located in an area with a population density of at least 
1,000 people per square mile that is constructed as part of an activity for which 
these permits are required must include one or more of the following safety 
features:  1) a shallow ledge around the periphery of the pond; 2) vegetation that is 
at least 24 inches high between the pond and any easy point of access; or 3) any 
other alternative safety feature authorized by DNR by rule.
Winter road safety improvement grant program

Fee for high capacity well approvals
Under current law, no person may construct a high capacity well, which is a 
well with a capacity of more than 100,000 gallons per day, without prior approval of 
DNR and payment of a $500 fee.  The bill increases that fee to $1,000.
Fee for CAFO permits
Under current law, a person who operates a concentrated animal feeding 
operation (CAFO) must have a WPDES permit from DNR.  A CAFO is a livestock 
operation that contains at least 1,000 animal units, that discharges pollutants to a 
navigable water, or that contaminates a well.  Current law requires a CAFO 
operator with a WPDES permit to pay an annual fee of $345 to DNR.  The bill 
increases the amount of this annual fee to $545.
Fee for WPDES general permits
Under current law, a person may not discharge a pollutant into waters of the 
state without a WPDES permit issued by DNR.  In addition to site-specific 
individual permits, DNR is authorized to issue a general permit that authorizes 
specified discharges in a designated area of the state.  The bill requires DNR to 
charge a $425 processing fee for these permits.
Storm water permit appropriation
Under current law, a person may need to obtain a permit from DNR to 
discharge storm water.  Current law appropriates money annually from the general 
fund for the administration of the storm water discharge permit program.  Storm 
water permit fees collected by DNR are credited to the storm water permit 
appropriation.
The bill changes the storm water permit appropriation from an annual to a 
continuing appropriation.  An annual appropriation is expendable only up to the 
amount shown in the schedule and only for the fiscal year for which made.  A 
continuing appropriation is expendable until fully depleted or repealed.
Lead service line replacement appropriation
Under current law, DOA and DNR administer the Safe Drinking Water Loan 
Program (SDWLP), which provides financial assistance from the environmental 
improvement program to local governmental units and to the private owners of 
community water systems that serve local governmental units for projects for the 
planning, designing, construction, or modification of public water systems.  DNR 
establishes a funding list for SDWLP projects and DOA allocates funding for those 
projects.
The bill creates a continuing appropriation from the general fund to the 
environmental improvement program for projects involving forgivable loans to 
private users of public water systems to replace lead service lines.2025 - 2026  Legislature

increases that limit by $725,900,000, to $3,323,300,000.
Bonding for urban storm water, flood control, and riparian restoration
Under current law, the state may contract up to $61,600,000 in public debt to 
provide financial assistance for projects that manage urban storm water and runoff 
and for flood control and riparian restoration projects.  The bill increases the 
bonding authority for these projects by $11,000,000.
Bonding for nonpoint source water pollution abatement
Under current law, the state may contract up to $57,050,000 in public debt to 
provide financial assistance for projects that control pollution that comes from 
diffuse sources rather than a single concentrated discharge source in areas that 
qualify as high priority due to water quality problems.  The bill increases the 
bonding authority for these projects by $10,000,000.
Bonding for Great Lakes contaminated sediment removal
Under current law, the state may contract up to $40,000,000 in public debt to 
provide financial assistance for projects to remove contaminated sediment from 
Lake Michigan or Lake Superior, or a tributary of Lake Michigan or Lake Superior, 
if DNR has identified the body of water as being impaired by the sediment. The bill 
increases the bonding authority for sediment removal projects by $9,000,000.
AIR QUALITY
Fee for stationary source operation permits
Under current state and federal law, certain stationary sources that emit air 
contaminants are required to receive an operation permit from DNR.  Current law 
requires DNR to promulgate rules for the payment and collection of fees by the 
owner or operator of a stationary source for which an operation permit is required 
under the federal Clean Air Act.  The bill increases the fee from $35.71 per ton of 
emissions to $63.69 per ton of emissions.
GENERAL  ENVIRONMENT
Environmental impacts to covered communities
Under current law, DNR issues various permits for the operation of facilities 
as part of DNR [s regulation of air and water pollution and hazardous and solid 
waste.  Under the bill, DNR may not issue permits for those facilities located in 
covered communities unless the permit applicant 1) prepares a report assessing the 
environmental impact of the facility, 2) makes the report available to the public and 
provides the report to DNR and to the municipality in which the covered

FIREARMS AND PUBLIC SAFETY
Background checks on all transfers of firearms
Under current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer may not transfer a 
handgun until the dealer has requested DOJ to perform a background check on the 
prospective transferee to determine if he or she is prohibited from possessing a 
firearm under state or federal law.  The bill generally prohibits any person from 
transferring any firearm, including the frame or receiver of a firearm, unless the 
transfer occurs through a federally licensed firearms dealer and involves a 
background check of the prospective transferee.  Under the bill, the following are 
excepted from that prohibition: a transfer to a firearms dealer or to a law 
enforcement or armed services agency; a transfer of a firearm classified as antique; 
or a transfer that is by gift, bequest, or inheritance to a family member.  A person 
who is convicted of violating the prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor and must be 
fined not less than $500 nor more than $10,000, may be imprisoned for not more 
than nine months, and may not possess a firearm for a period of two years.
Waiting period for handgun purchases
Under current law, a federally licensed firearms dealer may not transfer a 
handgun until the dealer has requested DOJ to perform a background check on the 
prospective transferee to determine if he or she is prohibited from possessing a 
firearm under state or federal law.  The bill prohibits the dealer from transferring a 
handgun to the transferee until 48 hours have passed since the firearms dealer 
requested the background check.
Self-assigned firearm exclusion
The bill requires DOJ to allow individuals to prohibit themselves from 
purchasing a firearm.  Under the bill, DOJ must maintain a database of individuals 
who voluntarily prohibit themselves from purchasing a firearm.  An individual may 
request inclusion in the database by submitting a request to DOJ that indicates the 
length of the prohibition they are requesting: a one-year, irrevocable prohibition; a 
five-year prohibition, the first year being irrevocable; or a 20-year prohibition, the 
first year being irrevocable.  During a revocable period, an individual may remove 2025 - 2026  Legislature

the prohibition by submitting to DOJ a request for removal, and DOJ must wait 48 
hours and remove the individual from the list.  The bill also requires DOJ, when 
responding to a request for a background check from a licensed firearms dealer 
regarding an individual who is in the database, to indicate that the individual is 
prohibited from purchasing a firearm.
Extreme risk protection injunctions
Under current law, a person is prohibited from possessing a firearm, and must 
surrender all firearms, if the person is subject to a domestic abuse injunction, a 
child abuse injunction, or, in certain cases, a harassment or an individuals-at-risk 
injunction.  If a person surrenders a firearm because the person is subject to one of 
those injunctions, the firearm may not be returned to the person until a court 
determines that the injunction has been vacated or has expired and that the person 
is not otherwise prohibited from possessing a firearm.  A person who is prohibited 
from possessing a firearm under such an injunction is guilty of a Class G felony for 
violating the prohibition.
The bill creates an extreme risk protection temporary restraining order (TRO) 
and injunction to prohibit a person from possessing a firearm.  Under the bill, either 
a law enforcement officer or a family or household member of the person may file a 
petition with a court to request an extreme risk protection injunction.  The petition 
must allege facts that show that the person is substantially likely to injure themself 
or another if the person possesses a firearm.
Under the bill, the petitioner may request the court to consider first granting 
a temporary restraining order.  If the petitioner requests a TRO, the petitioner must 
include evidence that there is an immediate and present danger that the person 
may injure themself or another if the person possesses a firearm and that waiting 
for the injunction hearing increases the immediate and present danger.
If the petitioner requests a TRO, the court must hear the petition in an 
expedited manner.  The judge must issue a TRO if, after questioning the petitioner 
and witnesses or relying on affidavits, the judge determines that it is substantially 
likely that the petition for an injunction will be granted and the judge finds good 
cause to believe there is an immediate and present danger that the person will 
injure themself or another if the person has a firearm and that waiting for the 
injunction hearing may increase the immediate and present danger.  If the judge 
issues a TRO, the TRO is in effect until the injunction hearing, which must occur 
within 14 days of the TRO issuance.  The TRO must require a law enforcement 
officer to personally serve the person with the order and to require the person to 
immediately surrender all firearms in their possession.  If a law enforcement officer 
is unable to personally serve the person, then the TRO requires the person to 
surrender within 24 hours all firearms to a law enforcement officer or a firearms 
dealer and to provide the court a receipt indicating the surrender occurred.
At the injunction hearing, the court may grant an extreme risk protection 
injunction ordering the person to refrain from possessing a firearm and, if the 
person was not subject to a TRO, to surrender all firearms he or she possesses if the 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 83 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is substantially likely 
to injure themself or another if the person possesses a firearm.  An extreme risk 
protection injunction is effective for up to one year and may be renewed.  A person 
who is subject to an extreme risk protection injunction may petition to vacate the 
injunction.  If a person surrenders a firearm because the person is subject to an 
extreme risk protection TRO or injunction, the firearm may not be returned to the 
person until a court determines that the TRO has expired or the injunction has 
been vacated or has expired and that the person is not otherwise prohibited from 
possessing a firearm.
A person who possesses a firearm while subject to an extreme risk protection 
TRO or injunction is guilty of a Class G felony.  In addition, a person who files a 
petition for an extreme risk protection injunction, knowing the information in the 
petition to be false, is guilty of the crime of false swearing, a Class H felony.
Persons prohibited from possessing a firearm following a conviction for a 
misdemeanor crime of domestic violence
Under federal law, a person is prohibited from possessing a firearm if he or she 
has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  Under state law, 
a person who is prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal or state law may 
not purchase a firearm or be issued a license to carry a concealed weapon.  State law 
requires DOJ, before approving a handgun purchase or issuing a license, to conduct 
a background check on the prospective purchaser or applicant to determine if the 
person is prohibited from possessing a firearm.  To determine if the person is 
prohibited under federal law, DOJ must review court records of all of the person [s 
criminal convictions to identify if any conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime 
of domestic violence under federal law.  DOJ must review the record to determine if 
the relationship between the offender and the victim qualifies as a domestic 
relationship and if the offender engaged in violent conduct when committing the 
crime.  The bill reorganizes two statutes—the crime of disorderly conduct and the 
definition of domestic abuse—so that DOJ is able to more easily determine if a 
conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal law.
First, under current law, a person is guilty of disorderly conduct if the person 
engages in violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, unreasonably loud, or 
otherwise disorderly conduct and if the conduct tends to cause or provoke a 
disturbance.  A person who has been convicted of disorderly conduct is prohibited 
from possessing a firearm if the disorderly conduct was a misdemeanor crime of 
domestic violence—that is, if the person engaged in violent conduct and if the 
relationship between the person and the victim was domestic.  The bill reorganizes 
the disorderly conduct statute to separate XviolentY conduct from the other types of 
disorderly conduct so that the court record clearly indicates that the crime was a 
violent crime.
Second, under current state law, Xdomestic abuse Y is defined as certain 
actions taken against a victim if the victim is related to the actor, has a child in 
common with the actor, or currently resides or has resided with the actor.  Unlike 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 84 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
state law, federal law does not define a crime as domestic violence if the only 
relationship is that the victim currently resides or has resided with the actor.  The 
bill reorganizes the statute defining domestic abuse so that a court record would 
indicate the exact nature of the relationship.  Therefore, under the bill, the court 
record would indicate when a person who is guilty under state law of a crime of 
domestic abuse is not guilty under federal law of a misdemeanor crime of domestic 
violence.
Undetectable firearms
The bill prohibits the manufacture, transportation, sale, possession, and 
carrying of firearms that cannot be detected by metal detectors or airport x-ray 
machines or scanners.  Federal law currently has a comparable prohibition; under 
the bill, the person would violate state law as well.  A person who violates the state 
prohibition is guilty of a Class G felony.
The bill prohibits the sale, posting, provision, or possession of plans for 
manufacturing an undetectable firearm.  A person who violates the prohibition is 
guilty of a Class H felony.
The bill also prohibits the possession of a frame or a receiver of a firearm that 
is not marked with a serial number.  A person who violates the prohibition is guilty 
of a Class I felony.
Prohibition on firearm accessories that accelerate the rate of fire
The bill prohibits the sale, manufacture, transfer, use, or possession of any 
firearm accessory that is designed to accelerate or functions to accelerate the rate of 
fire of a semiautomatic firearm.  A person who violates the prohibition is guilty of a 
Class G felony.
Reporting a lost or stolen firearm
Under the bill, a person who owns a firearm that is stolen or missing must 
report the theft or loss to a law enforcement agency within 24 hours of discovering 
the theft or loss.  A person who violates this requirement is guilty of a Class A 
misdemeanor for a first offense and guilty of a Class I felony for a subsequent 
offense.  A person who falsely reports a stolen or lost firearm is guilty of the 
current-law crime of obstructing an officer and is subject to a fine of up to $10,000 
or imprisonment of up to nine months, or both.
The bill also requires a person who commercially sells or transfers a firearm to 
provide the purchaser or transferee a written notice of the requirement, created in 
the bill, to report a theft or loss of a firearm within 24 hours of discovering it.  A 
seller or transferor who violates this requirement is subject to a fine of up to $500 or 
imprisonment for up to 30 days, or both.
Containers and trigger locks at sale
The bill requires a person who commercially sells or transfers a firearm to 
provide the purchaser or transferee with either a secure, lockable container that is 
designed to store a firearm or a trigger lock for the firearm.  A seller or transferor 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 85 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
who violates this requirement is subject to a fine of up to $500 or imprisonment for 
up to 30 days, or both.
Firearms in unattended retail facilities
The bill requires that a retail business that sells firearms must secure all 
firearms when the business is unattended.  Under the bill, the firearms must be 
secured in one of the following ways: in a locked fireproof safe, locked steel gun 
cabinet, or vault; in a steel-framed display case with specified reinforcements; with 
a hardened steel rod or cable; in a windowless, internal room that is equipped with 
a steel security door; or behind a steel roll-down door or security gate.
Storing a firearm when a child is present
The bill prohibits a person from storing or leaving a firearm at his or her 
residence if the person resides with a child who is under the age of 18, or knows a 
child who is under the age of 18 will be present in the residence, unless the firearm 
is in a securely locked box or container or other secure locked location or has a 
trigger lock engaged.  A person who violates this prohibition is guilty of a Class A 
misdemeanor for a first offense and a Class I felony for a subsequent offense.  This 
prohibition replaces the current law that penalizes a person who recklessly stores 
or leaves a loaded firearm within reach of a child who is under 14 if the child 
obtains it and does one of the following: 1) discharges the firearm and causes bodily 
harm or death (Class A misdemeanor); or 2) possesses or exhibits the firearm in a 
public place or endangers public safety (Class C misdemeanor).
Storing a firearm in a residence at which a prohibited person resides
The bill requires a person to store any firearm he or she possesses in a securely 
locked box or container or other secure locked location or with a trigger lock 
engaged if the person resides with a person who is prohibited from possessing a 
firearm under state law.  A person who violates this requirement is guilty of a Class 
A misdemeanor for a first offense and a Class I felony for a repeat offense.  State law 
currently prohibits the following persons from possessing a firearm: persons who 
have been convicted of a felony; persons found not guilty of a felony by reason of 
mental disease or defect; persons who are subject to certain injunctions such as a 
domestic abuse or child abuse injunction or, in certain cases, a harassment or an 
individuals-at-risk injunction; and persons who have been involuntarily committed 
for mental health treatment and ordered not to possess a firearm.
GAMBLING
Bingo and raffle fees
Under current law, an organization that conducts bingo and raffles must 
obtain a license from the Division of Gaming within DOA and pay all related license 
fees.  Bingo licensees, generally, must pay a $10 license fee for each bingo occasion, 
meaning a single gathering or session at which a series of successive bingo games is 
played, and a $5 license fee for an annual license for the designated member of the 
organization responsible for the proper utilization of gross receipts.  A bingo 
licensee that is a community-based residential facility, a senior citizen community 2025 - 2026  Legislature

ALL:all
center, or an adult family home that conducts bingo as a recreational or social 
activity must pay a $5 license fee.  Raffle licensees must pay a $25 license fee.  The 
bill doubles all bingo and raffle license fees.
Also, under current law, a 1 percent occupational tax is imposed on the first 
$30,000 in gross receipts derived from the conduct of bingo by a licensed 
organization in a year.  In gross receipts during a year that exceed $30,000, a 2 
percent occupational tax is imposed.  Under the bill, a 2 percent occupational tax is 
imposed on all gross receipts derived from the conduct of bingo by a licensed 
organization.
Gaming regulation and enforcement
Under current law and tribal gaming compacts, tribes make payments to the 
state to reimburse the state for costs relating to the regulation of certain gaming 
activities.  This revenue, called Indian gaming receipts, may be expended for 
various purposes.  The bill requires DOA to transfer portions of Indian gaming 
receipts to DOR to support DOR [s gaming regulation and enforcement activities. 
GENDER NEUTRAL TERMINOLOGY
Making references in the statutes gender neutral
The bill recognizes same-sex marriage by making references in the statutes to 
spouses gender-neutral, with the intent of harmonizing the Wisconsin Statutes 
with the holding of the U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges , 135 S. Ct. 2584, 
192 L. Ed. 2d 609 (2015), which recognizes that same-sex couples have a 
fundamental constitutional right to marriage.  The bill also recognizes legal 
parentage for same-sex couples under certain circumstances and adopts gender-
neutral parentage terminology.
The bill provides that marriage may be contracted between persons of the 
same sex and confers the same rights and responsibilities on married persons of the 
same sex that married persons of different sexes have under current law.  The bill 
defines XspouseY as a person who is legally married to another person of the same 
sex or a different sex and replaces every reference to Xhusband Y or XwifeY in current 
law with Xspouse.Y  The bill makes applicable to married persons of the same sex all 
provisions under current law that apply to married persons of different sexes.  
These provisions relate to such diverse areas of the law as income tax, marital 
property, inheritance rights, divorce, child and spousal support, insurance 
coverage, family and spousal recreational licenses, consent to conduct an autopsy, 
domestic abuse, and eligibility for various types of benefits, such as retirement or 
death benefits and medical assistance.
In addition to making statutory references to spouses gender-neutral, the bill 
specifies ways in which married couples of the same sex may be the legal parents of 
a child and, with some exceptions, makes current references in the statutes to 
XmotherY and Xfather,Y and related terms, gender-neutral.
Under current law, all of the following may adopt a child:  a husband and wife 
jointly, a husband or wife whose spouse is the parent of the child, and an unmarried 
adult.  Because the bill makes references in the statutes to spouses gender-neutral, 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 87 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
same-sex spouses jointly may adopt a child and become the legal parents of the 
child, and a same-sex spouse of a person who is the parent of a minor child may 
adopt the child and become the legal parent of his or her spouse [s child.
Under current law, if a woman is artificially inseminated under the 
supervision of a physician with semen donated by a man who is not her husband 
and the husband consents in writing to the artificial insemination of his wife, the 
husband is the natural father of any child conceived.  Under the bill, one spouse may 
also consent to the artificial insemination of his or her spouse and is the natural 
parent of the child conceived.  The artificial insemination is not required to take 
place under the supervision of a physician, but, if it does not, the semen used for the 
insemination must have been obtained from a sperm bank.
Under current law, a man is presumed to be the father of a child if he and the 
child[s natural mother 1) were married to each other when the child was conceived 
or born or 2) married each other after the child was born but had a relationship 
with each other when the child was conceived and no other man has been 
adjudicated to be the father or is presumed to be the father because the man was 
married to the mother when the child was conceived or born.  The paternity 
presumption may be rebutted in a legal action or proceeding by the results of a 
genetic test showing that the statistical probability of another man [s parentage is 
99.0 percent or higher.  The bill expands this presumption into a parentage 
presumption, so that a person is presumed to be the natural parent of a child if he or 
she 1) was married to the child [s established natural parent when the child was 
conceived or born or 2) married the child [s established natural parent after the 
child was born but had a relationship with the established natural parent when the 
child was conceived and no person has been adjudicated to be the father and no 
other person is presumed to be the child [s parent because he or she was married to 
the mother when the child was conceived or born.  The parentage presumption may 
still be rebutted by the results of a genetic test showing that the statistical 
probability of another person [s parentage is 99.0 percent or higher.  Expanding on 
current law, the bill allows for a paternity action to be brought for the purpose of 
rebutting the parentage presumption, regardless of whether that presumption 
applies to a male or female spouse.
Current law provides that a mother and a man may sign a statement 
acknowledging paternity and file it with the state registrar.  If the state registrar 
has received such a statement, the man is presumed to be the father of the child.  
Under current law, either person who has signed a statement acknowledging 
paternity may rescind the statement before an order is filed in an action affecting 
the family concerning the child or within 60 days after the statement is filed, 
whichever occurs first.  Under current law, a man who has filed a statement 
acknowledging paternity that is not rescinded within the time period is conclusively 
determined to be the father of the child.  The bill provides that two people may sign 
a statement acknowledging parentage and file it with the state registrar.  If the 
state registrar has received such a statement, the people who have signed the 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 88 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
statement are presumed to be the parents of the child.  Under the bill, a statement 
acknowledging parentage that is not rescinded conclusively establishes parentage 
with regard to the person who did not give birth to the child and who signed the 
statement.
The bill defines Xnatural parent Y as a parent of a child who is not an adoptive 
parent, whether the parent is biologically related to the child or not.  Thus, a person 
who is a biological parent, a parent by consenting to the artificial insemination of 
his or her spouse, or a parent under the parentage presumption is a natural parent 
of a child.  The definition applies throughout the statutes wherever the term 
Xnatural parent Y is used.  In addition, the bill expands some references in the 
statutes to Xbiological parent Y by changing the reference to Xnatural parent. Y
Gender neutral references on birth certificates
Generally, the bill substitutes the term XspouseY for Xhusband Y in the birth 
certificate statutes and enters the spouse, instead of the husband, of the person who 
has given birth on the birth certificate at times when a husband would currently be 
entered on a birth certificate.  The name of the person who has given birth is 
entered on a birth certificate when the person gives birth to a child, and current law 
specifies when another name should be entered on the birth certificate.  Current 
law requires that if a birth mother is married at any time from the conception to the 
birth of a child, then her husband [s name is entered on the birth certificate as the 
legal father of the child.  Under the bill, if a person who gives birth is married at any 
time from the conception to the birth of the child, then that person [s spouse [s name 
is entered as a legal parent of the child.  The bill also specifies that, in the instance 
that a second parent [s name is initially omitted from the birth certificate, if the 
state registrar receives a signed acknowledgement of parentage by people presumed 
to be parents because the two people married after the birth of the child, the two 
people had a relationship during the time the child was conceived, no person is 
adjudicated to be the father, and no other person is presumed to be the parent, then 
the state registrar must enter the name of the spouse of the person who gave birth 
as a parent on the birth certificate.

Presumptive eligibility for Wisconsin Shares
Under current law, an individual is eligible to receive a child care subsidy 
under the Wisconsin Shares program if DCF determines that the individual meets 
certain requirements, including requirements related to age of the child, income of 
the individual, and the individual [s participation in certain eligible activities.
Under the bill, DCF may find an individual presumptively eligible for a child 
care subsidy while DCF verifies the individual [s actual eligibility.  If DCF finds an 
individual presumptively eligible for the child care subsidy, DCF must immediately 
begin issuing benefits to the individual.  If DCF determines that the individual is 
actually ineligible, DCF must discontinue issuing benefits.  To be found 2025 - 2026  Legislature

presumptively eligible for the subsidies, an individual must submit a report to DCF 
that includes information establishing the individual [s actual eligibility and, based 
on the report, DCF must be able to plausibly assume that the individual is actually 
eligible for the subsidies.
Wisconsin Shares copayment increase structure
Under current law, if an individual is already receiving a Wisconsin Shares 
child care subsidy and the individual [s family income exceeds the maximum eligible 
income of 200 percent of the poverty line, the individual will continue to be eligible 
for the subsidy until or unless the individual [s family income exceeds 85 percent of 
the state median income.  Until that time when the individual [s income exceeds 85 
percent of the state median income, the individual [s copayment minimum for the 
Wisconsin Shares child care subsidy will increase on a sliding scale based on the 
amount that the individual [s family income increases.
The bill eliminates this copayment increase structure in order to comply with 
federal rule 89 FR 15366, effective April 30, 2024, which establishes that 
copayments for individuals receiving a child care subsidy from the federal Child 
Care and Development Fund may not exceed 7 percent of family income.  Under the 
bill, in general, if an individual is already receiving a Wisconsin Shares child care 
subsidy and the individual [s family income exceeds 85 percent of the state median 
income, the individual is no longer eligible for the Wisconsin Shares child care 
subsidy.
Wisconsin Shares like-kin update
2023 Wisconsin Act 119 extended kinship care eligibility to like-kin, in 
addition to relatives of a child.  XLike-kin Y is defined under current law as an 
individual who has a significant emotional relationship with a child or the child [s 
family that is similar to a familial relationship and who is not and has not 
previously been the child [s licensed foster parent and, for an Indian child, includes 
individuals identified by the child [s tribe according to tribal tradition, custom or 
resolution, code, or law.  The bill conforms language under the child care subsidy 
program, Wisconsin Shares, to this change so that references to kinship care are not 
limited to relatives.
Child care quality improvement program
The bill authorizes DCF to establish a program for making monthly payments 
and monthly per-child payments to certified child care providers, licensed child care 
centers, and child care programs established or contracted for by a school board.  
This new payment program is in addition to the current law system for providing 
child care payments under Wisconsin Shares.  The bill requires DCF to promulgate 
rules to implement the program, including establishing eligibility requirements 
and payment amounts and setting requirements for how recipients may use the 
payments, and authorizes DCF to promulgate these rules as emergency rules.  The 
bill funds the program through a new appropriation and by allocating federal 
moneys, including child care development funds and moneys received under the 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant program.2025 - 2026  Legislature

The bill eliminates the current law method by which DCF may modify 
maximum payment rates for child care providers under Wisconsin Shares based on 
a child care provider [s rating under the quality rating system known as YoungStar.
Wisconsin Shares is a part of the Wisconsin Works program under current 
law, which DCF administers and which provides work experience and benefits for 
low-income custodial parents who are at least 18 years old.  Under current law, an 
individual who is the parent of a child under the age of 13 or, if the child is disabled, 
under the age of 19, who needs child care services to participate in various 
education or work activities, and who satisfies other eligibility criteria may receive 
a child care subsidy for child care services under Wisconsin Shares.
Expanded Transform Milwaukee Jobs and Transitional Jobs programs
Under current law, DCF administers a temporary wage subsidy program for 
individuals who meet all of the following qualifications: 1) are at least 18 years old 
and, if over 25 years old, are the parent or primary relative caregiver of a child; 2) 
have a household income below 150 percent of the federal poverty line; 3) have been 
unemployed for at least four weeks; 4) are ineligible to receive unemployment 
insurance benefits; 5) are not participating in a Wisconsin Works employment 
position; and 6) satisfy applicable substance abuse screening, testing, and 
treatment requirements.  Under current law, funding is directed first to the 
program as established in Milwaukee County, called the Transform Milwaukee 
Jobs program, and next, if funding is available, to the program as established 
outside of Milwaukee County, called the Transitional Jobs program.
The bill provides funding for and requires DCF to establish the Expanded 
Transform Milwaukee Jobs program and Transitional Jobs program, which under 
the bill must be identical to the Transform Milwaukee Jobs program and 
Transitional Jobs program except that, to be eligible, an individual is not required 
to have an annual household income below 150 percent of the federal poverty line 
and, if over 25 years of age, is not required to be a parent or primary relative 
caregiver of a child.
Transform Milwaukee Jobs and Transitional Jobs programs
The bill modifies the qualifications for participating in the Transform 
Milwaukee Jobs and Transitional Jobs programs by removing the requirement that 
the individual has been unemployed for at least four weeks, and by specifying that 
anyone who is not receiving unemployment insurance benefits, regardless of their 
eligibility to receive those benefits, may participate.
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
Under current law, DCF allocates specific amounts of federal moneys, 
including child care development funds and moneys received under the TANF block 
grant program, for various public assistance programs.  Under the bill, TANF 
funding allocations are changed in the following ways, as compared to the funding 
allocation in the 2023 ]25 fiscal biennium:

11.  For the earned income tax credit supplement, total funding is increased by 
60 percent.
12.  For all other programs under TANF, funding is continued with a funding 
change of 6 percent or less.
The bill additionally allocates $3,472,000 in fiscal year 2025 ]26 and 
$6,944,000 in fiscal year 2026 ]27 for a child support debt reduction program and 
eliminates an allocation of $500,000 per fiscal year for skills enhancement grants.
Civil legal services grants
Under current law, DCF provides funding to the Wisconsin Trust Account 
Foundation, Inc. (the foundation), to provide civil legal services to TANF-eligible 
individuals in two ways:
1.  DCF provides up to $100,000 in each fiscal year in matching funds to the 
foundation for the provision of civil legal services to eligible individuals.  This grant 
does not specify what types of civil legal services may be provided.
2.  DCF provides a $500,000 grant in each fiscal year to the foundation to 
provide grants to programs, up to $75,000 each, that provide certain legal services 
to eligible individuals.  The legal services provided through this grant are limited to 
legal services in civil matters related to domestic abuse or sexual abuse or to 
restraining orders or injunctions for individuals at risk.
The bill removes the grant that requires matching funds and increases the 
grant to provide certain legal services to eligible individuals to $4,500,000 per fiscal 
year.  Under the bill, the foundation may additionally use this funding to provide to 
eligible individuals civil legal services related to eviction.  The bill removes the 
$75,000 cap on grants provided by the foundation to individual programs.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Child support debt reduction
The bill creates a program administered by DCF to provide debt reduction for 
child support.  Under the bill, if a noncustodial parent completes an eligible 
employment program, as determined by DCF by rule, and the custodial parent 
agrees to a reduction, the noncustodial parent is eligible for child support debt 
reduction in an amount up to $1,500.  Under the bill, a parent may not qualify for 
the debt reduction more than once in any 12-month period.
Child care water safety grant program
The bill requires DCF to award a grant each fiscal year to Community Water 
Services, Inc., to help child care providers access safe drinking water.
Grants for services for homeless and runaway youth
The bill increases the limit on the amount that DCF may award in each fiscal 
year to support programs that provide services for homeless and runaway youth 
from $400,000 to $2,872,800.
Tribal family services grants and funding for out-of-home-care placements 
by tribal courts
Current law uses Indian gaming receipts to fund tribal family service grants 
and unexpected or unusually high-cost placements of Indian children by tribal 
courts in foster homes, group homes, or residential care centers for children and 
youth, in the homes of a relative other than a parent, or in a supervised 
independent living arrangement (out-of-home care).  The bill appropriates GPR 
moneys for those purposes as well.
Healthy eating incentive pilot program
The bill modifies certain provisions of the healthy eating incentive pilot 
program.  The bill defines an eligible retailer, for purposes of the program, to be a 
retailer authorized to participate in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program, also known as the federal food stamp program.  Under current law, DHS 
must select, through a competitive selection process, one or more nonprofit 
organizations to administer the program statewide.  The bill modifies that 
requirement, instead requiring only that DHS select one or more third-party 
organizations through the competitive selection process.  Current law requires DHS 
to seek any available federal matching moneys from the Gus Schumacher Nutrition 
Incentive Program to fund the program.  The bill specifies that DHS must require 
any organization chosen to administer the program to fulfill that requirement to 
seek federal matching funds.  Under the bill, a third-party organization chosen to 
administer the program may retain for administrative purposes an amount not to 
exceed 33 percent of the total contracted amount or the applicable cap found in 
federal law or guidance, whichever is lower.
Electronic benefit transfer processing program
The bill requires DHS to provide electronic benefit transfer and credit and 
debit card processing equipment and services to farmers [ markets and farmers who 
sell directly to consumers as a payment processing program.  The bill specifies that 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 93 - LRB-2080/1

the electronic benefit transfer processing equipment and services must include 
equipment and services for the state food stamp program, which is known as 
FoodShare.  Under the bill, the vendor that processes the electronic benefit transfer 
and credit and debit card transactions must also process any local purchasing 
incentives.
Eliminating FSET drug testing requirement
2015 Wisconsin Act 55 required DHS to promulgate rules to develop and 
implement a drug screening, testing, and treatment policy, which DHS 
promulgated as ch. DHS 38, Wis. Adm. Code.  2017 Wisconsin Act 370 incorporated 
into statutes ch. DHS 38, relating to drug screening, testing, and treatment for 
recipients of the FoodShare employment and training program (FSET).  FoodShare 
provides financial assistance to purchase food items to individuals who have 
limited financial resources.  The bill eliminates the requirement to implement a 
drug screening, testing, and treatment policy and removes from the statutes the 
language incorporated by Act 370.
FSET work requirement
Current law requires DHS to require all able-bodied adults, with some limited 
exceptions, who seek benefits from the FoodShare program to participate in the 
FoodShare employment and training program, known as FSET, unless they are 
already employed.  The bill eliminates that requirement for able-bodied adults with 
dependents while retaining the requirement for able-bodied adults without 
dependents.
Eliminating FSET pay-for-performance requirement
Current law requires DHS to create and implement a payment system based 
on performance for entities that perform administrative functions for the 
FoodShare employment and training program, known as FSET.  DHS must base 
the pay-for-performance system on performance outcomes specified in current law.  
The bill eliminates the requirement for DHS to create a pay-for-performance system 
for FSET vendors.
EMERGENCY  SERVICES
Emergency medical services funding assistance
Under current law, DHS must annually distribute grants for vehicles, 
supplies, equipment, medication, or training to certain emergency medical 
responder departments and certain ambulance service providers under a funding 
formula consisting of an identical base amount plus a supplemental amount based 
upon the population of the primary service area or contract area.  Under the bill, 
the funding formula must consist of a base amount based on provider type and a 
supplemental amount based upon the population or other relevant factors of the 
primary service area or contract area.  Currently, grant recipients may not expend 
more than 15 percent of a grant on nondurable or disposable medical supplies or 
equipment and medications.  The bill removes the limitation for equipment.
In addition, current law requires DHS to distribute grants to emergency 2025 - 2026  Legislature

medical responder departments and certain ambulance service providers to pay for 
certain training, licensure, and certification requirements, including 
administration of the licensure examination for emergency medical technicians.  
Under the bill, the grants may be used to pay for administration of the licensure 
examination for any type of emergency medical services practitioner, not just 
emergency medical technicians.
Emergency medical services grant funding
The bill requires DHS to award grants each fiscal year to municipalities to 
improve or expand emergency medical services and creates an appropriation for 
that purpose.  From the moneys appropriated each fiscal year, DHS must award 25 
percent to municipalities to support the development of 24-7 paid service models in 
accordance with criteria developed by DHS.  DHS must award the remainder using 
a formula consisting of a base amount, determined by DHS, for each municipality, 
plus a supplemental amount based on the municipality [s population.
MEDICAL  ASSISTANCE
Medicaid expansion; elimination of childless adults demonstration project
BadgerCare Plus and BadgerCare Plus Core are programs under the state [s 
Medical Assistance program, which provides health services to individuals who 
have limited financial resources.  The federal Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act allows a state to receive an enhanced federal medical assistance 
percentage payment for providing benefits to certain individuals through a state [s 
Medical Assistance program.  The bill changes the family income eligibility level to 
up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line for parents and caretaker relatives 
under BadgerCare Plus and for childless adults currently covered under 
BadgerCare Plus Core and for those who are incorporated into BadgerCare Plus in 
the bill.  The bill requires DHS to comply with all federal requirements and to 
request any amendment to the state Medical Assistance plan, waiver of Medicaid 
law, or other federal approval necessary to qualify for the highest available 
enhanced federal medical assistance percentage for childless adults under the 
BadgerCare Plus program.
Under current law, certain parents and caretaker relatives with incomes of not 
more than 100 percent of the federal poverty line, before a 5 percent income 
disregard is applied, are eligible for BadgerCare Plus benefits.  Under current law, 
childless adults who 1) are under age 65; 2) have family incomes that do not exceed 
100 percent of the federal poverty line, before a 5 percent income disregard is 
applied; and 3) are not otherwise eligible for Medical Assistance, including 
BadgerCare Plus, are eligible for benefits under BadgerCare Plus Core.  The bill 
eliminates the childless adults demonstration project, known as BadgerCare Plus 
Core, as a separate program on July 1, 2025.
Current law, as created by 2017 Wisconsin Act 370, requires that DHS 
implement the BadgerCare Reform waiver as it relates to childless adults as 
approved by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) effective October 31, 2018.  The 2015 ]17 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 95 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
and 2017 ]19 biennial budget acts required DHS to submit a waiver request to the 
federal Department of Health and Human Services authorizing DHS to take 
certain actions, including imposing premiums on, requiring a health risk 
assessment of, and limiting the time of eligibility for recipients of BadgerCare Plus 
under the childless adults demonstration project waiver.  Act 370 required DHS to 
implement the childless adults BadgerCare Reform waiver by no later than 
November 1, 2019.  If JCF determines that DHS has not complied with the 
implementation deadline, has not made sufficient progress in implementing the 
BadgerCare Reform waiver, or has not complied with other requirements relating to 
approved waiver implementation, Act 370 allows JCF to reduce from moneys 
allocated for state operations or administrative functions DHS [s appropriation or 
expenditure authority, whichever is applicable, or change the authorized level of 
full-time equivalent positions for DHS related to the Medical Assistance program.  
In April 2021, CMS withdrew approval of the community engagement 
requirements that had previously been approved in the October 31, 2018, 
BadgerCare Reform waiver.  The 2018 waiver was set to expire December 31, 2023, 
but CMS approved a temporary extension to December 31, 2024.  As part of the 
approval of that extension, CMS removed authority for certain elements of the 
demonstration project, including disenrollment lockout periods, monthly 
premiums, health behavior assessments, health risk assessments, and the 
requirement for beneficiaries to answer questions about substance use treatment 
needs in order to remain eligible.  On October 29, 2024, CMS approved DHS [s 
request for an extension of the BadgerCare Reform waiver through December 31, 
2029, subject to the same limitations set forth in the 2023 temporary extension.
The bill eliminates the statutory implementation requirement for the 
BadgerCare Reform waiver, including the deadline and penalties, eliminates the 
statutory requirement for DHS to seek the waiver, and allows DHS to modify or 
withdraw the waiver.
Postpartum Medical Assistance coverage
The bill requires DHS to seek approval from the federal Department of Health 
and Human Services to extend until the last day of the month in which the 365th 
day after the last day of the pregnancy falls Medical Assistance benefits to women 
who are eligible for those benefits when pregnant.  Currently, postpartum women 
are eligible for Medical Assistance benefits until the last day of the month in which 
the 60th day after the last day of the pregnancy falls.  2021 Wisconsin Act 58 
required DHS to seek approval from the federal Department of Health and Human 
Services to extend these postpartum Medical Assistance benefits until the last day 
of the month in which the 90th day after the last day of the pregnancy falls.  On 
June 3, 2022, DHS filed a Section 1115 Demonstration Waiver application with the 
federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to extend postpartum coverage 
for eligible Medical Assistance recipients, as required by 2021 Wisconsin Act 58.

The bill requires DOR to include questions on an individual income tax return 
to determine whether the taxpayer or any member of the taxpayer [s household does 
not have health care coverage under a health insurance policy or health plan.  If the 
taxpayer indicates that the taxpayer or any member of the taxpayer [s household 
does not have health care coverage, DOR must, at the taxpayer [s request, forward 
the taxpayer [s response to DHS to have DHS evaluate whether the taxpayer or a 
member of the taxpayer [s household is eligible to enroll in the Medical Assistance 
program or whether the taxpayer or a member of the taxpayer [s household is 
eligible for subsidized health insurance coverage through a health insurance 
marketplace for qualified health plans under the federal Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act.  The bill specifies that DHS may not use any information 
provided to determine that the individual is ineligible to enroll in the Medical 
Assistance program.
Medical Assistance waiver for health-related social needs
The bill directs DHS to request a waiver from the federal Department of 
Health and Human Services to provide reimbursement for services for health-
related social needs under the Medical Assistance program.  Under the bill, DHS 
must provide reimbursement for those services if the waiver is granted.
Payment for school medical services
Under current law, if a school district or a cooperative educational service 
agency elects to provide school medical services and meets certain requirements, 
DHS is required to reimburse the school district or cooperative educational service 
agency for 60 percent of the federal share of allowable charges for the school medical 
services that they provide.  If the Wisconsin Center for the Blind and Visually 
Impaired or the Wisconsin Educational Services Program for the Deaf and Hard of 
Hearing elects to provide school medical services and meets certain other 
requirements, DHS is also required to reimburse DPI for 60 percent of the federal 
share of allowable charges for the school medical services that the Wisconsin Center 
for the Blind and Visually Impaired or the Wisconsin Educational Services 
Program for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing provide.  Further, under current law, 
DHS is required to reimburse school districts, cooperative educational service 
agencies, and DPI, on behalf of the Wisconsin Center for the Blind and Visually 
Impaired or the Wisconsin Educational Services Program for the Deaf and Hard of 
Hearing, for 90 percent of the federal share of allowable school medical services

Certified peer specialist services
The bill requires DHS to provide as a benefit and reimburse services provided 
by certified peer specialists under the Medical Assistance program.  The bill also 
adds services provided by certified peer specialists to a DHS program to coordinate 
and continue care following a substance use overdose.  A Xcertified peer specialist, Y 
as defined in the bill, is an individual who has experience in the mental health and 
substance use services system, who is trained to provide support to others, and who 
has received peer specialist or parent peer specialist certification.
The bill requires DHS to reimburse under the Medical Assistance program a 
certified peer specialist service that meets all of the following criteria:  the recipient 
of the certified peer specialist service is in treatment for or recovery from mental 
illness or a substance use disorder; the certified peer specialist provides the service 
under the supervision of a competent mental health professional and in 
coordination and accordance with the recipient [s individual treatment plan and 
treatment goals; and the certified peer specialist completes the training 
requirements specified by DHS.
Medical Assistance coverage of doula services
The bill requires DHS to request any necessary waiver or amendment to the 
state Medical Assistance plan to allow Medical Assistance reimbursement for doula 
services and, if any necessary waiver or amendment is approved, directs DHS to 
reimburse certified doulas for doula services provided to Medical Assistance 
recipients.  Doula services consist of childbirth education and support services, 
including emotional and physical support provided during pregnancy, labor, birth, 
and the postpartum period.
Medical Assistance coverage for incarcerated individuals
The bill authorizes DHS to submit a request to the secretary of the federal 
Department of Health and Human Services for a waiver of federal Medicaid law to 
conduct a demonstration project allowing prerelease coverage to incarcerated 
individuals for certain services under the Medical Assistance program for up to 90 
days before release if the individual is otherwise eligible for coverage under the 
Medical Assistance program.  The bill provides that if the waiver is approved, DHS 
may provide reimbursement under the Medical Assistance program for both the 
federal and nonfederal share of services, including case management services, 
provided to incarcerated individuals under the waiver.

The bill requires DHS to submit any necessary request to the federal 
Department of Health and Human Services for a state plan amendment or waiver 
of federal Medicaid law to implement a statewide contract for dental benefits 
through a single vendor under the Medical Assistance program.  If the federal 
government disapproves the amendment or waiver request, the bill provides that 
DHS is not required to implement the statewide contract.
Medical Assistance coverage for detoxification and stabilization services
The bill requires DHS to provide reimbursement for detoxification and 
stabilization services under the Medical Assistance program.  The bill requires 
DHS to submit to the federal government any request for federal approval 
necessary to provide the reimbursement for detoxification and stabilization 
services under the Medical Assistance program, and makes reimbursement 
contingent upon any needed federal approval.  The bill defines detoxification and 
stabilization services as adult residential integrated behavioral health stabilization 
service, residential withdrawal management service, or residential intoxication 
monitoring service.
The bill also requires DHS, through the community grants program it is 
required to administer, to distribute not more than $500,000 each fiscal year for 
grants to community-based withdrawal centers, including those certified as a 
residential intoxication monitoring service, residential withdrawal management 
service, or adult residential integrated behavioral health stabilization service.
Medical Assistance payments to rural health clinics
The bill modifies the methodology DHS must use for reimbursing rural health 
clinics for services provided to Medical Assistance recipients.  Currently, DHS 
reimburses rural health clinics for the reasonable costs of the services they provide.  
Under the bill, for services provided on or after July 1, 2026, DHS must reimburse 
rural health clinics using a payment methodology based on the federal Medicaid 
prospective payment system, which directs that reimbursement be provided to a 
rural health clinic at a rate that is based upon the rural health clinic [s per-visit 
costs in previous years, adjusted for medical cost inflation and for any change in the 
scope of services furnished by the rural health clinic.
Elimination of birth cost recovery
Under current law, as a condition of eligibility for benefits under the Medical 
Assistance program, a person is deemed to have assigned to the state by applying 
for or receiving benefits under the Medical Assistance program any rights to 
medical support or other payment of medical expenses from any other person.  
Current law further provides that if a mother of a child was enrolled in a health 
maintenance organization or other prepaid health care plan under the Medical 
Assistance program at the time of the child [s birth, then birth expenses that were 
incurred by the health maintenance organization or other prepaid health care plan 2025 - 2026  Legislature

recovered by the state under this process.
Eliminating legislative oversight of federal waivers.
Current law, as created by 2017 Wisconsin Act 370, prohibits DHS from 
submitting a request to a federal agency for a waiver or renewal, modification, 
withdrawal, suspension, or termination of a waiver of federal law or rules or for 
authorization to implement a pilot program or demonstration project unless 
legislation has been enacted specifically directing the submission of the request.  
For any legislation that requires submission of a request that has not yet been 
submitted, current law requires DHS to submit an implementation plan to JCF and 
submit its final proposed request to JCF for approval.  Current law requires DHS to 
take certain actions and submit monthly progress reports to JCF once a request has 
been submitted to the federal agency.  When the federal agency has approved the 
request in whole or in part and the request has not been fully implemented, current 
law requires DHS to submit its final implementation plan to JCF for approval.  
Current law allows JCF to reduce from moneys allocated for state operations or 
administrative functions the agency [s appropriation or expenditure authority or 
change the authorized level of full-time equivalent positions for the agency related 
to the program for which the request is required to be submitted if JCF determines 
that the state agency has not made sufficient progress or is not acting in accordance 
with the enacted legislation requiring the submission of the request.  The bill 
eliminates the requirement that legislation be enacted in order for DHS to submit a 
request for a waiver or renewal, modification, withdrawal, suspension, or 
termination of a waiver of federal law or rules or for authorization to implement a 
pilot program or demonstration project.  The bill also eliminates the legislative 
review procedure for requests for waivers, pilot programs, or demonstration projects 
required by current law created by Act 370.
Eliminating legislative review of Medicaid state plan amendments
The Medical Assistance program is the state [s Medicaid program and is jointly 
funded by the state and federal governments through a detailed agreement known 
as the state plan.  Under current law created by 2017 Wisconsin Act 370, DHS is 
required to submit to JCF under its passive review process any proposed Medical 
Assistance state plan amendment and any proposed change to a reimbursement 
rate for or supplemental payment to a Medical Assistance provider that has an 
expected fiscal effect of $7,500,000 or more from all revenue sources over a 12-
month period.  The bill eliminates this requirement to submit for JCF review 
Medical Assistance state plan amendments, changes to reimbursement rates, or 
supplemental payments.
Dental reimbursement pilot project reporting requirement
Under current law, DHS must distribute moneys under a dental 
reimbursement pilot project to increase the reimbursement rate for pediatric dental 
care and adult emergency dental services provided under the Medical Assistance 
program in Brown, Marathon, Polk, and Racine Counties and, if certain 
requirements are met, in any other county, as determined by DHS, where Medical 2025 - 2026  Legislature

Assistance recipients have the greatest need for pediatric dental care and adult 
emergency dental services.  In addition, current law requires DHS to submit a 
biennial report on the pilot project to the chief clerk of each house of the legislature, 
each standing committee of the legislature with jurisdiction over health or public 
benefits, and JCF.  The bill eliminates the reporting requirement.
Community support program
Currently, mental health and psychosocial rehabilitative services provided by 
a community support program are a benefit provided by the Medical Assistance 
program.  Under current law, for these services, a county pays the nonfederal share 
of the Medical Assistance reimbursement and DHS reimburses the service provider 
for the federal share of the Medical Assistance reimbursement. Under the bill, DHS 
must reimburse a county for both the federal and nonfederal share of the allowable 
charges for mental health and psychosocial rehabilitative services provided by a 
community support program.
Hospital assessment
Under current law, certain hospitals must pay an annual assessment that is 
equal to a percentage of the hospital [s gross patient revenues.  Currently, DHS 
must set the percentage so that the total amount of assessments collected in a fiscal 
year is $414,507,300.  The bill increases this amount to $1,341,839,500.  Under 
current law, institutions for mental disease, certain general psychiatric hospitals, 
and critical access hospitals are not required to pay the assessment.  The bill also 
exempts rehabilitation hospitals and long-term acute care hospitals from paying 
the assessment.  Currently, DHS must use a portion of the assessments collected to 
pay for services provided under the Medical Assistance program by the hospitals 
from which the assessments are collected.  Under current law, the payments must 
equal the amount collected divided by 61.68 percent.  The bill increases that 
percentage to 62.39.
Under current law, a critical access hospital must also pay an annual 
assessment that is equal to a percentage of the critical access hospital [s gross 
inpatient revenues.  Currently, DHS must use a portion of the assessments 
collected to pay for services provided by critical access hospitals under the Medical 
Assistance program.  Under current law, the payments must equal the amount 
collected divided by 61.68 percent.  Under the bill, the payments must equal 
$49,392,400, and moneys from a biennial GPR appropriation for Medical Assistance 
program benefits may also be used as needed to fund the nonfederal share of 
payments for the services.
Children [s behavioral health managed care
The bill authorizes DHS to request a waiver from the federal Department of 
Health and Human Services to administer a children [s behavioral health specialty 
managed care program under the Medical Assistance program.  The bill provides 
that DHS may administer the children [s behavioral health specialty managed care 
program if the waiver is granted.2025 - 2026  Legislature

program. The disabled children [s long-term support waiver program provides 
services to children who have developmental, physical, or severe emotional 
disabilities and who are living at home or in another community-based setting.
Pediatric inpatient supplement
The bill establishes in statute reference to supplemental funding totaling 
$2,000,000 to be distributed by DHS to certain acute care hospitals located in 
Wisconsin that have a total of more than 12,000 inpatient days in the hospital [s 
acute care pediatric units and intensive care pediatric units, not including neonatal 
intensive care units.  In addition, under the bill, DHS may distribute additional 
funding of $7,500,000 in each state fiscal year to hospitals that are free-standing 
pediatric teaching hospitals located in Wisconsin that have a Medicaid inpatient 
utilization rate greater than 45 percent.
CHILDREN
Expanding eligibility for subsidized guardianships and kinship care 
payments
Under current law, a guardian appointed by the juvenile court or tribal court 
to provide care to a child adjudged to be in need of protection or services or a 
juvenile adjudged to be in need of protection or services, if the juvenile [s parent or 
prior guardian is unable or needs assistance to control the juvenile, may receive 
monthly subsidized guardianship payments from DCF or a county department of 
human or social services (county department) reimbursed by DCF or an Indian 
tribe reimbursed by DCF.  A guardian may receive such payments only if certain 
conditions have been met, including that 1) the child, if 14 years of age or over, has 
been consulted with regarding the guardianship arrangement; 2) the guardian has 
a strong commitment to caring for the child permanently; 3) the guardian is 
licensed as the child [s foster parent, which licensing includes an inspection of the 
guardian [s home under rules promulgated by DCF; 4) the guardian and all adult 
residents of the guardian [s home have passed a criminal background investigation; 
and 5) prior to being named as guardian of the child, the guardian entered into a 
subsidized guardianship agreement with DCF, the county department, or the 
Indian tribe.
Under the bill, a guardian appointed by the juvenile court or tribal court to a 
juvenile adjudged to be delinquent or a juvenile adjudged to be in need of protection 
or services for any reason may receive monthly subsidized guardianship payments 
from DCF, a county department, or an Indian tribe.
Under current law, a kinship care provider who is providing temporary care to 
a child or juvenile adjudged to be in need of protection or services may receive 
monthly kinship care payments from DCF, a county department, or an Indian tribe.  
Under the bill, a kinship care provider who is providing temporary care to a juvenile 
alleged to be delinquent may receive such payments.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 102 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
Under current law, kinship care payments are administered directly by DCF 
in Milwaukee County.  Under the bill, a county department in Milwaukee County 
may administer kinship care payments and be reimbursed by DCF.
The bill also requires that in a dispositional order placing a juvenile who has 
been adjudicated delinquent outside his or her home, in addition to the findings 
required under current law, the court must also find that continued placement in 
the juvenile [s home would be contrary to the welfare of the juvenile.  Under current 
law, such an order must include a finding that the juvenile [s current residence will 
not safeguard the welfare of the juvenile or the community due to the serious nature 
of the act for which the juvenile was adjudicated delinquent.
DCF child support assignment and referrals
The bill removes the assignment to the state of child support orders and 
arrears existing at the time a child enters foster care.  The bill also removes the role 
of DCF and a county department in providing child support referrals and collecting 
child support for families with children in out-of-home care except if DCF or a 
county department determines that such a referral is appropriate under rules to be 
promulgated by DCF.  The bill eliminates from the Juvenile Justice Code 
requirements that the juvenile court order child support, except for modification of 
existing orders, and order the parents of a juvenile under DCF supervision to 
contribute towards the costs of certain sanctions, dispositions, or placements.
The bill also adds language to the Xbest interests of the child Y factor that 
under current law must be used by the family court when modifying a child support 
order.  The bill specifies that, for a child in out-of-home care under the Children [s 
Code or the Juvenile Justice Code, this factor includes the impact on the child of 
family expenditures to improve any conditions in the home that would facilitate the 
reunification of the child with the child [s family, if appropriate, and the importance 
of a placement that is the least restrictive of the rights of the child and the parents 
and the most appropriate for meeting the needs of the child and the family.
Foster care and kinship care rates and payments
The bill eliminates the separate monthly basic maintenance rates that the 
state or a county pays to foster parents certified to provide level one care so that 
age-based monthly basic maintenance rates are paid to all foster parents.  The bill 
changes the rates paid to all kinship care providers, which under current law are 
$375 per month for a child of any age, to be the same as the age-based monthly basic 
maintenance rates paid to foster parents.  The bill also increases these age-based 
monthly basic maintenance rates by 5 percent.  Beginning on January 1, 2026, the 
monthly rates are $463 for a child under five years of age, $507 for a child 5 to 11 
years of age, $575 for a child 12 to 14 years of age, and $601 for a child 15 years of 
age or over.
The bill provides that, in addition to the monthly rates currently paid to a 
foster home or a kinship care provider who is providing care and maintenance for a 
child, DCF or a county department of human services or social services may make 
emergency payments for kinship care to a kinship care provider or for foster care to 
a foster home if any of the following conditions are met:2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 103 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
1.  The governor has declared a state of emergency, or the federal government 
has declared a major disaster, that covers the locality of the home of the kinship 
care provider who is providing foster care in the home (home).
2.  This state has received federal funding to be used for child welfare purposes 
due to an emergency or disaster declared for the locality of the home.
3.  DCF has determined that conditions in this state or in the locality of the 
home have resulted in a temporary increase in the costs borne by foster homes and 
kinship care providers, including a pandemic or other public health threat, a 
natural disaster, or unplanned school closures of five consecutive days or more.
The bill provides that DCF must determine the amount of an emergency 
payment based on available funding and may promulgate rules governing the 
provision of the payments.
The bill changes the statutes and the administrative code to make all foster 
homes and kinship care providers eligible to receive exceptional payments to enable 
siblings or a minor parent and minor children to reside together and to receive an 
initial clothing allowance.  Under current law, these payments are only available to 
foster homes certified to provide higher than level one care.
Benefits eligibility screening
The bill directs DCF or a county department (the department) to periodically 
screen each child under the placement and care of the department in out-of-home 
care, other than children placed with kinship care providers receiving kinship care 
payments, to determine if the child is eligible for federal or state benefits (benefits).  
If the department finds that a child is eligible for benefits, the department must do 
all of the following:
1.  Apply for the benefits for which the child is eligible on behalf of the child.
2.  Ensure that the child, the child [s guardian ad litem, and the child [s parent, 
guardian, or Indian custodian receive proper and timely notice of any application for 
benefits, the results of an application for benefits, and any appeal of a denial of 
benefits that could be or is filed on behalf of the child.
3.  Provide the child with training covering financial literacy and maintaining 
benefit eligibility prior to the child aging out of out-of-home care.
If the department is appointed as representative payee for a child receiving 
benefits under the bill, the department must conserve the child [s benefits in 
protected accounts that avoid asset limitations for federal and state programs, 
consistent with the best interests of the child; provide a periodic accounting to the 
child, the child [s attorney or guardian ad litem, and the child [s parent, guardian, or 
Indian custodian regarding the conservation and use of the child [s benefits while 
the child is in the department [s care; and work with the child and the appropriate 
federal agency to return remaining funds to the child or another fiduciary once the 
child exits the department [s care.
The department may contract with a public or private agency to fulfill the 
requirements of the bill.  The department may not use benefits received on behalf of 
a child to pay for the costs of caring for the child in out-of-home care, but may use 2025 - 2026  Legislature

obligated to, is required to, or has agreed to provide.
The bill requires DCF to promulgate rules to implement the bill and 
authorizes DCF to promulgate emergency rules for the period before permanent 
rules take effect.
Representation of parents in CHIPS proceedings
Under current law, a parent is generally not entitled to representation by a 
public defender in a proceeding under the Children [s Code in which a child is 
alleged to be in need of protection or services.  However, a pilot program that began 
in 2018 requires the SPD to assign counsel to any nonpetitioning parent in these 
cases in Brown, Outagamie, Racine, Kenosha, and Winnebago Counties.  This five-
county pilot program is set to expire after June 2025.  The bill extends the 
expiration date of the pilot program to December 31, 2026.
Independent living services eligibility expansion
The bill expands a current program under which DCF must distribute 
$231,700 each fiscal year for the purpose of assisting individuals who reach the age 
of 18 while residing in out-of-home care to make the transition from out-of-home 
care to a successful adulthood.  The bill expands this program to also assist an 
individual who resided in out-of-home care, including in the home of like-kin or in 
the home of a person who is not a relative or like-kin, for at least six months after 
his or her 16th birthday; an individual who was placed under a guardianship as a 
child in need of protection or services on or after his or her 16th birthday; and an 
individual who was adopted on or after his or her 16th birthday following time in 
out-of-home care.  The bill also allows the services funded by this program to be 
offered until age 23, and allows the funding to be distributed to Indian tribes and 
private and public agencies and organizations.  The bill also removes the 
requirement that DCF distribute a minimum of $231,700 in each fiscal year for the 
program.
Specialized congregate care payments
The bill grants DCF the authority to expend funds to provide payments for 
specialized services to children with high acuity needs in congregate care facilities.  
XCongregate care facilities Y means group homes, shelter care facilities, and 
residential care centers for children and youth.
Children and family services
Under current law, DCF must distribute $101,551,400 in fiscal year 2023 ]24 
and $101,939,600 in fiscal year 2024 ]25 to counties for children and family 
services.  The bill updates those amounts to $104,969,500 in fiscal year 2025 ]26 
and $110,869,200 in fiscal year 2026 ]27.
Child care partnership grant program
The bill authorizes DCF to establish a grant program to award funding to 
businesses, nonprofits, or governmental entities (businesses) that provide or wish 
to provide child care services for their employees. The bill allows such a grant to be 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 105 - LRB-2080/1

used to reserve child care placements for local business employees, pay child care 
tuition, and other costs related to child care.  Under the bill, a grant recipient with 
50 or fewer employees must provide at least 10 percent matching funds and a grant 
recipient with more than 50 employees must provide at least 15 percent matching 
funds.  The bill allows DCF to promulgate rules to administer the grant program, 
including to determine eligibility for a grant, and authorizes DCF to promulgate 
these as emergency rules.
Child care access program
The bill requires DCF to contract with Wonderschool, Inc., and Wisconsin 
Early Childhood Association, Inc., to increase access to high-quality child care.  The 
bill requires DCF to enter into a $4,500,000 contract with Wonderschool to 1) 
increase the child care workforce by launching an online software platform that is 
linked to DCF [s website to connect child care providers with child care workers and 
a pool of substitute child care workers and 2) build child care capacity in this state.  
The bill also requires DCF to enter into a $5,500,000 contract with Wisconsin Early 
Childhood Association to provide 1) existing or prospective child care providers with 
licensing and certification assistance, 2) coaching and other support services, and 
3) tax education assistance for child care centers that provide care and supervision 
for between four and eight children.
Grants for out-of-school time programs
The bill directs DCF to make grants to out-of-school time programs, defined as 
structured programs or activities that meet all of the following conditions:
1.  To the extent practicable, the program or activity is led by adult mentors 
using evidence-based or evidence-informed practices and is provided to school-age 
children before school, after school, or during the summer.
2.  The program or activity does not supplant instructional services provided 
by a school or result in academic credit for students.
3.  The program or activity relates to improving social, emotional, academic, or 
career readiness competencies; reducing negative behaviors, including violence and 
crime, tobacco use, alcohol and substance abuse, disengagement from school, school 
suspension, truancy, and health-compromising behaviors; providing a safe out-of-
school time environment; or engaging in career exploration or formal or informal 
work-based learning.
The bill requires DCF to promulgate rules to implement the grant program 
and authorizes DCF to promulgate emergency rules for the period before 
permanent rules take effect.
HEALTH
Complex patient pilot program
The bill requires DHS to select, using a competitive grant selection process, 
partnership groups to be designated as participating sites for a complex patient 
pilot program and then award grants to the partnership groups selected.  The bill 
provides that a partnership group is one or more hospitals in partnership with one 
or more post-acute facilities.  The bill provides that DHS must solicit feedback 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 106 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
regarding the pilot program from representatives of health care system 
organizations, long-term care provider organizations, long-term care operator 
organizations, patient advocate groups, insurers, and any other organization 
determined to be relevant by the secretary of health services.  Under the bill, DHS 
must require each partnership group that applies to be designated as a site for the 
pilot program to address certain issues in its application, including 1) the number of 
complex patient care beds that will be set aside in a post-acute facility or through 
implementation of another innovative model of patient care in a post-acute facility 
to which participating hospitals agree; 2) defined goals and measurable outcomes of 
the partnership both during and after the pilot program; 3) the types of complex 
patients for whom care will be provided; 4) an operating budget for the proposed 
site; and 5) the participant group [s expertise to successfully implement the 
proposal.
The bill requires DHS to develop a methodology to evaluate the pilot program 
and contract with an independent organization to complete the evaluation.  Under 
the bill, DHS may pay the organization [s fee from the funding appropriated for the 
pilot program.  The bill requires DHS to give additional weight to partnership 
groups that would ensure geographic diversity.  Upon completion of the required 
evaluation, the independent organization contracted by DHS to conduct the 
evaluation must provide the evaluation to DHS.
Health care entity oversight and transparency
The bill creates various requirements and procedures related to health care 
entity oversight and transparency.
The bill establishes procedures for review of proposed material change 
transactions involving health care entities.  The bill requires DHS to promulgate 
rules to define, for purposes of the provisions in the bill, what entities are 
considered to be health care entities and what constitutes a material change 
transaction.  The bill requires, among other things, that before consummating any 
material change transaction, a health care entity must submit written notice to 
DHS.  Under the bill, DHS must post information about the proposed transaction 
on its website no less than 30 days before the anticipated implementation of the 
material change transaction or, if the department is notified less than 30 days 
before the anticipated implementation, as soon as is practicable.  The bill includes 
procedures for DHS to review and approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove a 
proposed transaction.  The bill provides for post-transaction oversight, including 
possible enforcement by the attorney general and DHS, as well as monitoring of 
compliance and required reporting.  The bill also prohibits the corporate practice of 
medicine and requires DHS to promulgate rules to define what conduct constitutes 
the corporate practice of medicine within the scope of the prohibition.
The bill adds transparency requirements relating to ownership and control of 
health care entities.  Under the bill, with certain exceptions, each health care entity 
must report certain information relating to ownership and control to DHS annually 
and upon the consummation of a material change transaction involving the entity, 
including the legal name of the entity, its business address, and locations of 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 107 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
operations, as well as a current organizational chart showing the business 
structure of the health care entity and the name and contact information of a 
representative of the entity.  Beginning in 2028, the bill requires DHS to post on its 
publicly available website an annual report based on the health care entity 
reporting from the previous year.  The bill includes enforcement mechanisms, 
including granting DHS authority to audit and inspect the records of any health 
care entity that has failed to submit complete reporting information or if DHS has 
reason to question the accuracy or completeness of the information submitted.  The 
bill requires DHS to conduct annual audits of a random sample of health care 
entities to verify compliance with and accuracy and completeness of required 
reporting.  The bill includes penalties for failure to submit a required report and for 
submitting a report containing false information.  Health care entities consisting of 
independent health care providers or provider organizations without any third-
party ownership or control entities, with 10 or fewer physicians or less than $10 
million in annual revenue, are subject to forfeiture of up to $50,000 for each report 
not provided or containing false information, and all other health care entities are 
subject to a forfeiture of up to $500,000 for each report not provided or containing 
false information.
The bill also includes authority for DHS to promulgate rules to implement the 
provisions of the bill.
Women[s health block grant
Under current law, DHS must allocate women [s health funds, which are funds 
received by the state from the federal government under Title V of the federal Social 
Security Act, to develop and maintain an integrated system of community health 
services and to maximize the coordination of family planning services.  Current law 
excludes from the definition of Xfamily planning Y the performance, promotion, 
encouragement, or counseling in favor of, or referral either directly or through an 
intermediary for, voluntary termination of pregnancy but includes in the definition 
of Xfamily planning Y the provision of nondirective information explaining prenatal 
care and delivery or infant care, foster care, or adoption.  Current law provides that 
DHS must distribute women [s health funds only to public entities.  However, 
current law allows those public entities to provide some or all of the funds received 
to other public entities or private entities but only if the recipients of the funds do 
not provide abortion services, make referrals for abortion services, or have an 
affiliate that provides abortion services or makes referrals for abortion services.  
The bill continues to allow public entities that receive funds from DHS to provide 
some or all of the funds to other public or private entities but eliminates the 
restriction on which public or private entities may receive those funds.  The bill also 
includes in the definition of Xfamily planning Y the provision of nondirective 
information explaining pregnancy termination.
Nursing home bed access
Under current law, DHS licenses nursing home beds and enforces a maximum 
limit on the number of these licensed beds in the state.  The bill reduces that limit 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 108 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
from 51,795 to 25,415.  The bill also directs DHS to allocate 125 nursing home beds 
to applicants that agree to prioritize admissions of patients with complex needs and 
patients who have been unable to find appropriate placement at another facility.
Newborn screening program
In general, under current law, newborns must be tested for certain congenital 
and metabolic disorders as specified in rules promulgated by DHS.  The federal 
Department of Health and Human Services maintains a list of disorders for which 
it recommends testing in newborns, known as the federal Recommended Uniform 
Screening Panel (RUSP).
Under the bill, DHS must evaluate each disorder that is included in the RUSP 
as of January 1, 2025, to determine whether newborns in this state should be tested 
for that disorder.  This requirement does not apply to any disorder in the RUSP if, 
as of January 1, 2025, the disorder is already included in the list of disorders for 
which newborns must be tested in this state.  In addition, the bill requires DHS to 
evaluate any disorder added to the RUSP after January 1, 2025, to determine 
whether newborns in this state should be tested for that newly added disorder.  If 
DHS determines newborns should not be tested for the disorder, DHS must 
annually review medical literature and DHS [s capacity and resources to test for the 
disorder in order to determine whether to reevaluate the inclusion of the disorder in 
newborn testing in this state.  If, in any of these evaluations or reevaluations, DHS 
determines that a disorder in the RUSP should be added to the list of disorders for 
which newborns must be tested in this state, the bill requires DHS to promulgate 
rules to add that disorder.
The requirements for evaluations, reviews, and reevaluations under the bill do 
not apply to a disorder in the RUSP if DHS is in the process of adding, by rule, the 
disorder to the list of disorders for which newborns must be tested in this state.  
However, if the rule-making procedure for that disorder does not result in 
promulgation of a rule, then DHS must consider the disorder under the review and 
reevaluation procedures under the bill.
Electrocardiogram screening pilot project for middle school and high 
school athletes in Milwaukee and Waukesha Counties
The bill directs DHS to develop a pilot program to provide electrocardiogram 
screenings for participants in middle school and high school athletics programs in 
Milwaukee and Waukesha Counties.  DHS is required to award $4,067,200 in 
grants in fiscal year 2026 ]27 to local health departments to implement the 
program.  The bill specifies that participation in the program by participants in 
middle school and high school athletics programs must be optional.
Alzheimer [s Family and Caregiver Support Program
Under current law, DHS is required to allocate funds to agencies to be used for 
the administration and implementation of an Alzheimer [s Family and Caregiver 
Support Program for persons with Alzheimer [s disease and their caregivers.  
Current law provides that DHS may not distribute more than $3,058,900 in each 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 109 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
fiscal year for services to persons with Alzheimer [s disease and their caregivers.  
The bill increases that limit to $3,558,900 in each fiscal year.
Maternal and child health grants
The bill authorizes DHS to distribute up to $800,000 in each fiscal year to 
organizations whose mission is to improve maternal and child health in Wisconsin.
Mobile dental clinic grants
The bill requires DHS to award grants to community health centers to procure 
and operate mobile dental clinics.  A community health center is a health care 
entity that provides primary health care, health education, and social services to 
low-income individuals.
Grants for free and charitable clinics and FQHC look-alikes
Under current law, DHS must annually award $2,250,000 in grants to free 
and charitable clinics.  The bill increases that amount to $2,500,000 annually.  Free 
and charitable clinics are nonprofit health care organizations that provide health 
services to individuals who are uninsured, underinsured, or have limited or no 
access to primary, specialty, or prescription care.
The bill also requires DHS to annually award $200,000 in grants to federally 
qualified health center (FQHC) look-alikes.  Under the bill, a grant to an FQHC 
look-alike may not exceed $100,000.  XFQHCY is a federal designation for health 
care entities that meet certain requirements, including providing primary health 
care services to medically underserved populations, and receive federal grant 
moneys.  XFQHC look-alike Y is a federal designation for health care entities that 
meet all of the requirements of FQHCs but do not receive federal FQHC grant 
moneys.
Health care provider training grants
Under current law, DHS must distribute grants to hospitals, health systems, 
and educational entities that form health care education and training consortia for 
allied health professionals in an amount up to $125,000 per consortium in each 
fiscal year.  The grants may be used for curriculum and faculty development, tuition 
reimbursement, or clinical site or simulation expenses.
Current law also requires DHS to distribute grants to hospitals and clinics 
that provide training opportunities for advanced practice clinicians in an amount 
up to $50,000 per hospital or clinic in each fiscal year and to give preference to 
training programs that include rural hospitals and rural clinics as clinical training 
locations.  The grants must be used to pay for the costs of operating a clinical 
training program for advanced practice clinicians.  Current law requires grant 
recipients under both grant programs to match the grants through their own 
funding sources.
The bill combines those grant programs under a single section of the statutes 
and funds the grants from a single appropriation.  The bill removes the current law 
matching requirement for grant recipients and the grant amount  caps.  The bill 
also requires DHS to distribute grants to health systems that provide training 
opportunities for advanced practice clinicians and to hospitals, health systems, 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 110 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
clinics, and educational entities that form health care education and training 
consortia for behavioral health providers.  In awarding any grant under the bill, 
DHS must give preference to training programs that include rural hospitals and 
rural clinics as clinical training locations.  The bill specifies that acceptable uses of 
grant moneys include reasonable expenses incurred by a trainee, expenses related 
to planning and implementing a training program, and up to $5,000 in equipment 
expenses.
Falls prevention funding
The bill directs DHS to award $450,000 in each of fiscal years 2025 ]26 and 
2026]27 to an organization committed to reducing falls among older adults for the 
purpose of statewide falls prevention awareness and initiatives.
Assistive technology services
Under current law, DHS awards grants for certain community programs.  The 
bill allows DHS to distribute up to $250,000 in each fiscal year for grants to provide 
assistive technology services.
Community dental health coordinators
The bill requires DHS to award grants to support community dental health 
coordinators in rural regions of the state.  Community dental health coordinators 
are individuals who help facilitate oral health care for families and individuals, 
particularly in underserved communities.
Grant funding for diaper banks
Under current law, DHS is required to award grants for certain community 
programs.  The bill allows DHS to distribute up to $500,000 in each fiscal year as 
grants to diaper banks to provide diapers to families in need.
Health care provider innovation grants
The bill requires DHS to award $7,500,000 in fiscal year 2025 ]26 as grants to 
health care providers and long-term care providers to implement best practices and 
innovative solutions to increase worker recruitment and retention.
Medical debt collections reporting
The bill prohibits a health care provider, or a billing administrator or debt 
collector acting on behalf of a health care provider, from reporting to a consumer 
reporting agency that a debt arising from services provided by the health care 
provider is in collections status unless 1) the health care provider provided a 
written statement to the patient describing the unpaid amount and due date and 
that included the name and address of the health care provider that provided the 
services, 2) the written statement includes a statement indicating that if payment 
is not received, the debt may be reported to a credit reporting agency, 3) six months 
have passed since the due date listed on that statement, and 4) the patient does not 
dispute the charges.
Statewide poison control program
Under current law, DHS must implement a statewide poison control system 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 111 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
that provides statewide poison control services 24 hours a day and 365 days a year 
and provides poison information and education to health care professionals and the 
public.  Current law provides that DHS must distribute funding up to $425,000 in 
each fiscal year to supplement the operation of the system and to provide for the 
statewide collection and reporting of poison control data. The bill increases this 
amount to $482,500.
Conversion of lead poisoning and lead services grant appropriation from 
annual to continuing.
The bill converts an appropriation to DHS for the purpose of providing lead 
poisoning or lead exposure prevention grants from an annual appropriation to a 
continuing appropriation.  Annual appropriations are appropriations expendable 
only for the fiscal year for which they are made.  Continuing appropriations are 
appropriations that are expendable until fully depleted or repealed by the 
legislature.
Mike Johnson grants
The bill increases from $4,000,000 to $4,500,000 the annual maximum 
amount of Mike Johnson life care and early intervention services grants that DHS 
awards to organizations for HIV-related services, including needs assessments, 
assistance in procuring services, counseling and therapy, home care services and 
supplies, advocacy, case management services, and early intervention services.
Grants for pediatric health psychology residency and fellowship training

of individuals impacted by trauma and to develop the capacity of organizations to 
treat and prevent trauma.
BEHAVIORAL  HEALTH  AND DEVELOPMENTAL  DISABILITIES
Psychiatric residential treatment facilities
The bill establishes a DHS certification process for psychiatric residential 
treatment facilities.  The bill defines a psychiatric residential treatment facility as 
a nonhospital facility that provides inpatient comprehensive mental health 
treatment services to individuals under the age of 21 who, due to mental illness, 
substance use, or severe emotional disturbance, need treatment that can most 
effectively be provided in a residential treatment facility.  Psychiatric residential 
treatment facilities must be certified by DHS to operate.
The bill also provides that services through a psychiatric residential 
treatment facility are reimbursable under the Medical Assistance program.  The 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 112 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
bill requires DHS to submit to the federal government any request for federal 
approval necessary to provide the reimbursement for services by a psychiatric 
residential treatment facility under the Medical Assistance program.
Under current law, DHS must award grants for certain community programs.  
The bill allows DHS to distribute up to $1,790,000 each fiscal year to support 
psychiatric residential treatment facilities.
988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline grants
The bill requires DHS to award grants to organizations that provide crisis 
intervention services and crisis care coordination to individuals who contact the 
national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline from anywhere within the state.  Currently, 
DHS partners with Wisconsin Lifeline to provide statewide 988 crisis hotline 
services.
Crisis stabilization facilities grants
The bill requires DHS to award grants for services at facilities providing crisis 
stabilization services.  Under the bill, Xcrisis stabilization services Y are optional 
emergency mental health services that provide short-term, intensive, community-
based services to avoid the need for inpatient hospitalization.
Crisis program enhancement grants
The bill expands the crisis program enhancement grant program to include 
grants to counties, regions comprising multiple counties, or municipalities to 
establish and enhance law enforcement and behavioral health services emergency 
response collaboration programs.  Under current law, the crisis program 
enhancement grant program requires DHS to award grants to counties or regions of 
multiple counties to establish or enhance crisis programs to serve individuals 
having crises in rural areas.  The bill instructs DHS to annually award a total 
amount of $2,000,000 in each fiscal biennium to establish and enhance law 
enforcement and behavioral health services emergency response collaboration 
programs.  The bill requires any entity that receives a grant to establish and 
enhance law enforcement and behavioral health services emergency response 
collaboration programs to contribute at least 25 percent of the grant amount 
awarded for the purpose that the grant money is received.
Crisis urgent care and observation facilities
The bill amends a biennial appropriation to DHS for grants to support crisis 
urgent care and observation facilities to make it a continuing appropriation.  
Biennial appropriations are appropriations that are expendable for the fiscal 
biennium for which they are made.  Continuing appropriations are appropriations 
that are expendable until fully depleted or repealed by a subsequent action of the 
legislature.
Extended intensive treatment surcharge
Under current law, an individual may be placed at or transferred to a state 
center for the developmentally disabled if DHS and the individual [s county of 
residence agree upon a maximum discharge date for the individual, among other 2025 - 2026  Legislature

requirements.  Currently, DHS may impose a surcharge on a county for certain 
services provided at a center for the developmentally disabled after an individual [s 
maximum discharge date.  Under current law, all moneys received as payment for 
the surcharge must be provided to counties for onetime costs associated with 
relocating individuals from a center for the developmentally disabled.  Under the 
bill, the surcharge must be used instead for the provision of alternative services by 
mental health institutes and centers for the developmentally disabled, such as 
residential, dental, and mental health services.
Funding for Winnebago Mental Health Institute
The bill transfers moneys from the general fund to a program revenue 
appropriation for DHS to support the operations of Winnebago Mental Health 
Institute.
Mental health consultation program
The bill combines the child psychiatry consultation program with additional 
services into a new mental health consultation program.  The bill also splits off 
funding for the existing addiction medicine consultation program into a separate 
appropriation.
Currently, the child psychiatry consultation program assists participating 
clinicians in providing care to children with mental health care needs and provides 
referral support and additional services.  Current law requires DHS to convene 
interested persons, including the Medical College of Wisconsin, to develop a plan 
and standards for a comprehensive mental health consultation program 
incorporating various psychiatry specialties, including addiction medicine; a 
perinatal psychiatry consultation program; and the child psychiatry consultation 
program.  This requirement is eliminated in the bill along with the separate child 
psychiatry consultation program.  Under current law, the addiction medicine 
consultation program assists participating clinicians in providing care to patients 
with substance use addiction and provides referral support and additional services.  
The bill retains the program, but establishes a new appropriation to fund the 
program.
The bill requires an organization to administer a mental health consultation 
program (MHCP) that incorporates a comprehensive set of mental health 
consultation services and may include perinatal, child, adult, geriatric, pain, 
veteran, and general mental health consultation services.  Under the bill, the 
organization that currently administers the child psychiatry consultation program 
must administer the MHCP during the 2025 ]26 fiscal year, but DHS may contract 
with another organization in subsequent fiscal years.  The contracting organization 
may contract with any other entity to perform any operations and satisfy any 
requirements of the MHCP.  The contracting organization must do all of the 
following: ensure that mental health providers providing services through the 
MHCP have the appropriate credentials as described in the bill, maintain 
infrastructure to provide services statewide on every weekday, provide consultation 
services as promptly as practicable, report to DHS any information DHS requires, 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 114 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
conduct surveys of participating clinicians as described in the bill, and provide 
certain specified services.  Those specified services are the following: support for 
clinicians participating in the MHCP to assist in the management of mental health 
concerns; triage-level assessments to determine the most appropriate response; 
diagnostics and therapeutic feedback when medically appropriate; and recruitment 
of other practices to a provider [s services.  The MHCP must be able to provide 
consultation services by telephone and email but may also provide services by other 
means.  In addition to the services required in the bill, which are eligible for 
funding by DHS, the contracting organization may provide any of the services 
specified in the bill that are eligible for funding by DHS.
HOUSING
WHEDA housing programs modifications
The bill makes modifications to three housing programs administered by 
WHEDA:  the residential housing infrastructure revolving loan program, also 
known as the Infrastructure Access program; the main street housing 
rehabilitation revolving loan program, also known as the Restore Main Street 
program; and the commercial-to-housing conversion revolving loan program, also 
known as the Vacancy-to-Vitality program.
For the Infrastructure Access program, the bill does all of the following:
1.  Allows a loan to a developer to provide for up to 33 percent of total project 
costs and a loan to a governmental unit to provide for up to 25 percent of total 
project costs.  Under current law, a loan to developers may provide for up to 20 
percent of total project costs and a loan to a governmental unit may provide for up to 
10 percent of total project costs.
2.  Permits up to 25 percent of the amount of a loan to a developer to be used 
for improvements to private infrastructure.  Under current law, a loan may be used 
for improvements to only infrastructure that is or will be owned, maintained, or 
provided for or to a governmental unit or infrastructure in a rural area that is 
transferred to public use.
3.  Allows tribal housing authorities to receive loans as developers of eligible 
projects.
For the Restore Main Street program, the bill does all of the following:
1.  Allows a loan to provide for up to $50,000 per dwelling unit or 33 percent of 
total project costs, whichever is less.  Under current law, a loan may provide for up 
to $20,000 per dwelling unit or 25 percent of total project costs, whichever is less.
2.  Allows loans to be awarded to projects under the jurisdiction of a federally 
recognized American Indian tribe or band.
For the Vacancy-to-Vitality program, the bill does all of the following:
1.  Allows a loan to provide for up to 33 percent of total project costs.  Under 
current law, a loan may provide up to $1,000,000 per project or 20 percent of total 
project costs, whichever is less.
2.  Permits housing developments with fewer than six dwelling units to be 
eligible for a loan.  Under current law, an eligible housing development must have 
fewer than 16 dwelling units.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 115 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
3.  Allows loans to be awarded to projects under the jurisdiction of a federally 
recognized American Indian tribe or band.
In addition, the bill does the following for each of the three programs:
1.  Removes the requirements that a governmental unit have updated the 
housing element of its comprehensive plan within five years in order to be eligible 
for a loan and permits projects to benefit from a tax incremental district and to use 
historic tax credits.
2.  For the purpose of establishing that a governmental unit has reduced the 
costs of housing as part of applying for a loan, allows the governmental unit to 
submit to WHEDA measures taken by the governmental unit on or after January 1, 
2015.  Under current law, a governmental unit or political subdivision must show 
cost-reduction measures taken on or after January 1, 2023.
3.  Allows a loan to be awarded for projects on tribal reservation or trust lands 
not subject to property taxes in this state.
Discrimination in housing based on receipt of rental or housing assistance
Current open housing law prohibits discrimination in housing based on sex; 
race; color; sexual orientation; disability; religion; national origin; marital status; 
family status; status as a victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking; 
lawful source of income; age; or ancestry.  The bill prohibits discrimination in 
housing based on receipt of rental or housing assistance in the form of a 
contribution from a third party.
Capital reserve fund bonding limit
Under current law, WHEDA issues notes and bonds for most WHEDA 
programs, including housing programs for individuals and families of low or 
moderate income.  Current law prohibits WHEDA from issuing notes and bonds 
that are secured by a capital reserve fund if the total aggregate outstanding 
principal amount would exceed $1,000,000,000.  The bill increases this limit to 
$1,300,000,000.
Low-income housing tax credit
Under current law, WHEDA may certify a person to claim, for a period of up to 
six years, a state tax credit if the person has an ownership interest in a low-income 
housing project in Wisconsin and qualifies for the federal low-income housing tax 
credit program.  The bill increases the amount of credits that WHEDA may 
annually certify from $42,000,000 to $100,000,000.  The bill also requires that the 
project be allocated the federal credit and financed with tax-exempt bonds that are 
not subject to the federal credit [s volume cap—as opposed to any tax-exempt bonds, 
as required under current law—and allows WHEDA to waive these requirements to 
the extent that WHEDA anticipates that sufficient tax-exempt private activity bond 
volume cap under federal law will not be available to finance low-income housing 
projects in any year.
Affordable housing and workforce development grants
The bill requires DOA to establish a competitive grant program to award 
grants to cities, villages, towns, counties, school districts, and businesses, whether 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 116 - LRB-2080/1

operated for profit or not for profit, to fund the start-up of programs focused on 
developing the skilled workforce by building or rehabilitating affordable housing in 
their communities.
Grants to incentivize eliminating zoning barriers to affordable housing
The bill requires DOA to establish a competitive grant program to award 
grants to cities, villages, towns, counties, and federally recognized American Indian 
tribes and bands in the state that adopt one or more of the policy initiatives 
enumerated in the bill to eliminate zoning barriers for the creation or expansion of 
affordable housing.
Homeless case management services grants
Under current law, DOA may award up to 10 grants of up to $50,000 each year 
to shelter facilities for case management services provided to homeless families.  
The bill eliminates the limit on the number of grants that may be awarded and 
raises the grant limit to $75,000.
Geographic distribution of housing grants
Under current law, DOA may award grants to provide homeless individuals 
with housing and other supportive services to facilitate their movement to 
independent living.  DOA must ensure that the funds for the grants are reasonably 
balanced among geographic areas of the state that correspond to the geographic 
areas served by each continuum of care organization designated by the federal 
Department of Housing and Urban Development.  Under the bill, the geographic 
areas of the state among which DOA must balance funds for the grants need not 
correspond to the geographic areas served by each continuum of care organization.
Grants to Milwaukee County Housing First
The bill directs DOA to award two grants of $100,000 in fiscal years 2025 ]26 
and 2026 ]27 to the Milwaukee County Department of Health and Human Services 
to support Milwaukee County [s Housing First initiative.
Whole-home upgrade grants
The bill establishes a pilot program under which DOA must award one or more 
grants to Walnut Way Conservation Corp. for the purpose of funding home 
improvements in low-income households in a first class city (presently only 
Milwaukee) that have one or more of the following goals:  1) reducing carbon 
emissions; 2) reducing energy burdens; 3) creating cost savings; or 4) creating 
healthier living environments.  The bill authorizes DOA to establish eligibility 
requirements and other program guidelines for the grant program and allows a 
grant recipient to use grant moneys for administrative costs.
Housing quality standards grants
The bill requires DOA to award grants to owners of rental housing units in 
Wisconsin for purposes of satisfying applicable housing quality standards.2025 - 2026  Legislature

INSURANCE
Prescription Drug Affordability Review Board
The bill creates the Prescription Drug Affordability Review Board, whose 
purpose is to protect Wisconsin residents and other stakeholders from the high 
costs of prescription drugs.  The board consists of the commissioner of insurance 
and the following members, all of whom are appointed by the governor for four-year 
terms:
1.  Two members who represent the pharmaceutical drug industry, at least 
one of whom is a licensed pharmacist.
2.  Two members who represent the health insurance industry.
3.  Two members who represent the health care industry, at least one of whom 
is a licensed practitioner.
4.  Two members who represent the interests of the public.
The bill requires the board to meet in open session at least four times per year 
to review prescription drug pricing information.  The board must provide at least 
two weeks [ public notice of its meetings, make the meeting [s materials publicly 
available at least one week prior to meeting, and provide the opportunity for public 
comment.  The bill imposes conflict of interest requirements for the board relating 
to recusal and public disclosure of certain conflicts.  The bill directs the board to 
access and assess drug pricing information, to the extent practicable, by accessing 
and assessing information from other states, by assessing spending for the drug in 
Wisconsin, and by accessing other available pricing information.
Under the bill, the board must conduct drug cost affordability reviews.  The 
first step in the reviews is for the board to identify prescription drugs whose launch 
wholesale acquisition cost exceeds specified thresholds, prescription drugs whose 
increase in wholesale acquisition cost exceeds specified thresholds, and other 
prescription drugs that may create affordability challenges for the health care 
system in Wisconsin.  For each identified prescription drug, the board must 
determine whether to conduct an affordability review by seeking stakeholder input 
and considering the average patient cost share for the drug.  During an affordability 
review, the board must determine whether use of the prescription drug that is fully 
consistent with the labeling approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration 
or standard medical practice has led or will lead to an affordability challenge for the 
health care system in Wisconsin.  In making this determination, the bill requires 
the board to consider a variety of factors, which include the following:
1.  The drug [s wholesale acquisition cost.
2.  The average monetary price concession, discount, or rebate the 
manufacturer provides, or is expected to provide, for the drug to health plans.
3.  The total amount of price concessions, discounts, and rebates the 
manufacturer provides to each pharmacy benefit manager for the drug.
4.  The price at which therapeutic alternatives have been sold and the average 
monetary concession, discount, or rebate the manufacturer provides, or is expected 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 118 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
to provide, to health plan payors and pharmacy benefit managers for therapeutic 
alternatives.
5.  The costs to health plans based on patient access consistent with federal 
labeled indications and recognized standard medical practice.
6.  The impact on patient access resulting from the drug [s cost relative to 
insurance benefit design.
7.  The current or expected dollar value of drug-specific patient access 
programs that are supported by the manufacturer.
8.  The relative financial impacts to health, medical, or social services costs 
that can be quantified and compared to baseline effects of existing therapeutic 
alternatives.
9.  The average patient copay or other cost sharing for the drug.
If the board determines that a prescription drug will lead to an affordability 
challenge, the bill directs the board to establish an upper payment limit for that 
drug that applies to all purchases and payor reimbursements of the drug dispensed 
or administered to individuals in Wisconsin.  In establishing the upper payment 
limit, the board must consider the cost of administering the drug, the cost of 
delivering it to consumers, and other relevant administrative costs.  For certain 
drugs, the board must solicit information from the manufacturer regarding the 
price increase and, if the board determines that the price increase is not a result of 
the need for increased manufacturing capacity or other effort to improve patient 
access during a public health emergency, the board must establish an upper 
payment limit equal to the drug [s cost prior to the price increase.
Office of the Public Intervenor
The bill creates the Office of the Public Intervenor, attached to OCI.  Under 
the bill, the Office of the Public Intervenor assists individuals with claims, policies, 
appeals, and other legal actions related to pursuing insurance coverage for medical 
procedures, prescription medications, and other health care services.  The bill 
authorizes the office to levy an assessment on insurance providers based upon their 
premium volume for health insurance policies written in the state.
Prescription drug importation program
The bill requires the commissioner of insurance, in consultation with persons 
interested in the sale and pricing of prescription drugs and federal officials and 
agencies, to design and implement a prescription drug importation program for the 
benefit of and that generates savings for Wisconsin residents.  The bill establishes 
requirements for the program, including all of the following:  1) the commissioner 
must designate a state agency to become a licensed wholesale distributor or 
contract with a licensed wholesale distributor and to seek federal certification and 
approval to import prescription drugs; 2) the program must comply with certain 
federal regulations and import from Canadian suppliers only prescription drugs 
that are not brand-name drugs, have fewer than four competitor drugs in this 
country, and for which importation creates substantial savings; 3) the 
commissioner must ensure that prescription drugs imported under the program are 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 119 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
not distributed, dispensed, or sold outside of Wisconsin; and 4) the program must 
have an audit procedure to ensure the program complies with certain requirements 
specified in the bill.  Before submitting the proposed program to the federal 
government for certification, the commissioner must submit the proposed program 
to JCF for its approval.
State prescription drug purchasing entity
The bill requires OCI to conduct a study on the viability of creating or 
implementing a state prescription drug purchasing entity.
Exemption from prior authorization requirements
The bill allows the commissioner of insurance to establish, by rule, that any 
health insurance policy or plan that uses a prior authorization process must exempt 
health care providers from obtaining prior authorizations for a health care item or 
service for a period of time established by the commissioner if, in the most recent 
evaluation period established by the commissioner, the health insurance policy or 
plan has approved or would have approved not less than a certain proportion of 
prior authorization requests, as established by the commissioner, submitted by the 
health care provider for the health care item or service.  The commissioner may 
specify the health care items or services that may be subject to this exemption.  
Further, the commissioner may specify how health care providers may obtain an 
exemption from obtaining prior authorizations under the bill, including by 
providing a process for automatic evaluation.
Prior authorization transparency
The bill imposes several regulations on the use of prior authorization 
requirements used by health care plans.  Under the bill, Xprior authorization Y is 
defined to mean the process by which a health care plan or a contracted utilization 
review organization determines the medical necessity and medical appropriateness 
of otherwise covered health care services.
The bill requires health care plans to maintain a list of services for which prior 
authorization is required and publish the list on its website to be accessible by 
members of the general public without requiring the creation of an account or the 
entry of any credentials or personal information.  Further, the bill requires health 
care plans to make the current prior authorization requirements and restrictions 
that it uses accessible and conspicuously posted on its website or on the website of a 
contracted utilization review organization for enrollees and providers.
The bill provides that any clinical review criteria on which a prior 
authorization requirement or restriction is based must satisfy certain criteria, 
including that the criteria are based on nationally recognized, generally accepted 
standards except where provided by law, that the criteria are developed in 
accordance with the current standards of a national medical accreditation entity, 
and that the criteria ensure quality of care and access to needed health care 
services.
The bill prohibits a health care plan from denying a claim for failure to obtain 
prior authorization if the prior authorization requirement was not in effect on the 
date that the service was provided.  Further, the bill prohibits health care plans and 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 120 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
utilization review organizations contracted with health care plans from deeming 
supplies or services as incidental and from denying a claim for supplies or services 
if a provided health care service associated with the supplies or services receives 
prior authorization or if a provided health care service associated with the supplies 
or services does not require prior authorization.
Finally, the bill provides that if a health care plan intends to impose a new 
prior authorization requirement or restriction or intends to amend a prior 
authorization requirement or restriction, the health care plan must provide all 
providers contracted with the health care plan with advanced written notice of the 
new or amended requirement or restriction no less than 60 days before the new or 
amended requirement or restriction is implemented.  No health care plan may 
implement a new or amended prior authorization requirement or restriction unless 
the health care plan or a contracted utilization review organization has updated the 
post on its website to reflect the new or amended prior authorization requirement 
or restriction.
Inpatient mental health prior authorization
The bill prohibits health insurance policies and self-insured governmental 
health plans that cover inpatient mental health services from requiring prior 
authorization for the provision or coverage of those services.  Health insurance 
policies are referred to as disability insurance policies in the bill, and a self-insured 
governmental health plan is a self-funded health plan of the state or a county, city, 
village, town, or school district.
Coverage of individuals with preexisting conditions and other insurance 
market regulations
The bill requires certain health plans to guarantee access to coverage; 
prohibits plans from imposing preexisting condition exclusions; prohibits plans 
from setting premiums or cost-sharing amounts based on health status-related 
factors; prohibits plans from setting lifetime or annual limits on benefits; requires 
plans to cover certain essential health benefits; requires coverage of certain 
preventive services by plans without a cost-sharing contribution by an enrollee; 
sets a maximum annual amount of cost sharing for enrollees; and designates risk 
pool, medical loss ratio, and actuarial value requirements.
The bill requires every individual health insurance policy, referred to in the 
bill as health benefit plans, to accept every individual who, and every group health 
insurance policy to accept every employer that, applies for coverage, regardless of 
the sexual orientation, the gender identity, or any preexisting condition of any 
individual or employee who will be covered by the plan.  The bill allows health 
benefit plans to restrict enrollment in coverage to open or special enrollment 
periods and requires the commissioner of insurance to establish a statewide open 
enrollment period that is no shorter than 30 days for every individual health benefit 
plan.  The bill prohibits a group health insurance policy, including a self-insured 
governmental health plan, from imposing a preexisting condition exclusion.  The 
bill also prohibits an individual health insurance policy from reducing or denying a 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 121 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
claim or loss incurred or disability commencing under the policy on the ground that 
a disease or physical condition existed prior to the effective date of coverage.
A health benefit plan offered on the individual or small employer market or a 
self-insured governmental health plan may not vary premium rates for a specific 
plan except on the basis of 1) whether the plan covers an individual or a family; 2) 
the area in the state; 3) age; and 4) tobacco use, as specified in the bill.  An 
individual health benefit plan or self-insured health plan is prohibited under the 
bill from establishing rules for the eligibility of any individual to enroll based on 
health status-related factors, which are specified in the bill.  A self-insured health 
plan or an insurer offering an individual health benefit plan is also prohibited from 
requiring an enrollee to pay a greater premium, contribution, deductible, 
copayment, or coinsurance amount than is required of an otherwise similarly 
situated enrollee based on a health status-related factor. Current state law 
prohibits group health benefit plans from establishing rules of eligibility or 
requiring greater premium or contribution amounts based on a factor related to 
health status.  The bill adds to these current law requirements for group health 
benefit plans that the plan may not require a greater deductible, copayment, or 
coinsurance amount based on a health status-related factor.
Under the bill, an individual or group health benefit plan or a self-insured 
governmental health plan may not establish lifetime or annual limits on the dollar 
value of benefits for an enrollee or a dependent of an enrollee under the plan.  The 
bill specifies a maximum amount of cost sharing that a plan may impose as the 
amount calculated under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(ACA).
The bill requires individual and small employer plans to have either a single 
statewide risk pool for the individual market and a single pool for the small 
employer market or a single statewide risk pool for a combination of the individual 
and small employer markets.  The bill requires individual and small employer plans 
to have a medical loss ratio of at least 80 percent and larger group plans to have a 
medical loss ratio of at least 85 percent.  The medical loss ratio is the proportion of 
premium revenues that the plan spends on clinical services and quality 
improvement.  The bill also requires individual and small employer plans to provide 
a level of coverage that is designed to provide benefits that are actuarially 
equivalent to at least 60 percent of the full actuarial value of the benefits provided 
under the plan.  An actuarial value of 60 percent corresponds to a bronze tier plan 
under the ACA.
The bill requires certain health insurance policies and governmental self-
insured health plans to cover essential health benefits that will be specified by the 
commissioner of insurance by rule.  The bill specifies a list of requirements that the 
commissioner must follow when establishing the essential health benefits including 
certain limitations on cost sharing and the following general categories of benefits, 
items, or services in which the commissioner must require coverage: ambulatory 
patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 122 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
mental health and substance use disorder services, prescription drugs, 
rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, laboratory services, preventive 
and wellness services and chronic disease management, and pediatric services.  If 
an essential health benefit specified by the commissioner is also subject to its own 
mandated coverage requirement, the bill requires the health insurance policy or 
self-insured health plan to provide coverage under whichever requirement provides 
the insured or plan participant with more comprehensive coverage.
The bill requires health insurance policies and governmental self-insured 
health plans to cover certain preventive services and to provide coverage of those 
preventive services without subjecting that coverage to deductibles, copayments, or 
coinsurance.  The preventive services for which coverage is required are specified in 
the bill.  The bill also specifies certain instances when cost-sharing amounts may be 
charged for an office visit associated with a preventive service.
Preventing surprise bills for emergency medical services and other items 
and services
The bill requires defined network plans, such as health maintenance 
organizations, and certain preferred provider plans and self-insured governmental 
plans that cover benefits or services provided in either an emergency department of 
a hospital or an independent freestanding emergency department to cover 
emergency medical services without requiring a prior authorization determination 
and without regard to whether the health care provider providing the emergency 
medical services is a participating provider or facility.  If the emergency medical 
services for which coverage is required are provided by a nonparticipating provider, 
the plan must 1) not impose a prior authorization requirement or other limitation 
that is more restrictive than if the service was provided by a participating provider; 
2) not impose cost sharing on an enrollee that is greater than the cost sharing 
required if the service was provided by a participating provider; 3) calculate the 
cost-sharing amount to be equal to the recognized amount specified under federal 
law; 4) provide, within 30 days of the provider [s or facility [s bill, an initial payment 
or denial notice to the provider or facility and then pay a total amount to the 
provider or facility that is equal to the amount by which an out-of-network rate 
exceeds the amount it received in cost sharing from the enrollee; and 5) count any 
cost-sharing payment made by the enrollee for the emergency medical services 
toward any in-network deductible or out-of-pocket maximum as if the cost-sharing 
payment was made for services provided by a participating provider or facility.
For coverage of an item or service that is provided by a nonparticipating 
provider in a participating facility, a plan must 1) not impose a cost-sharing 
requirement for the item or service that is greater than the cost-sharing 
requirement that would have been imposed if the item or service was provided by a 
participating provider; 2) calculate the cost-sharing amount to be equal to the 
recognized amount specified under federal law; 3) provide, within 30 days of the 
provider [s bill, an initial payment or denial notice to the provider and then pay a 
total amount to the provider that is equal to the amount by which the out-of-2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 123 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
network rate exceeds the amount it received in cost sharing from the enrollee; and 
4) count any cost-sharing payment made by the enrollee for the items or services 
toward any in-network deductible or out-of-pocket maximum as if the cost-sharing 
payment was made for items or services provided by a participating provider.  A 
nonparticipating provider providing an item or service in a participating facility 
may not bill or hold liable an enrollee for more than the cost-sharing amount unless 
the provider provides notice and obtains consent as described in the bill.  However, 
if the nonparticipating provider is providing an ancillary item or service that is 
specified in the bill, and the commissioner of insurance has not specifically allowed 
providers to bill or hold an enrollee liable for that item or service by rule, the 
nonparticipating provider providing the ancillary item or service in a participating 
facility may not bill or hold liable an enrollee for more than the cost-sharing 
amount.
Under the bill, a provider or facility that is entitled to a payment for an 
emergency medical service or other item or service may initiate open negotiations 
with the defined network plan, preferred provider plan, or self-insured 
governmental health plan to determine the amount of payment.  If the open 
negotiation period terminates without determination of the payment amount, the 
provider, facility, or plan may initiate the independent dispute resolution process as 
specified by the commissioner of insurance.  If an enrollee of a plan is a continuing 
care patient, as defined in the bill, and is obtaining services from a participating 
provider or facility, and the contract is terminated because of a change in the terms 
of the participation of the provider or facility in the plan or the contract is 
terminated, resulting in a loss of benefits under the plan, the plan must notify the 
enrollee of the enrollee [s right to elect to continue transitional care, provide the 
enrollee an opportunity to notify the plan of the need for transitional care, and 
allow the enrollee to continue to have the benefits provided under the plan under 
the same terms and conditions as would have applied without the termination until 
either 90 days after the termination notice date or the date on which the enrollee is 
no longer a continuing care patient, whichever is earlier.
Health insurance claims
The bill imposes upon insurers certain requirements for health insurance 
claims processing and denials, including a requirement to process claims within a 
reasonable time frame that prevents an undue delay in care, to provide a detailed 
explanation of a claim denial, and to disclose whether the insurer uses artificial 
intelligence or algorithmic decision-making in processing claims.  The bill also 
prohibits certain actions by an insurer with respect to health insurance claims, 
including using vague or misleading terms to deny a claim, stalling review of a 
claim to avoid timely payment, allowing non-physician personnel to determine 
whether care is medically necessary, mandating prior approval for routine or urgent 
procedures in a manner that causes harmful delays, or requiring an insured to fail 
a cheaper treatment before approving coverage for necessary care.  The bill directs 
insurers to annually publish a report about their claim denials for health insurance 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 124 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
policies and their use of artificial intelligence or algorithmic decision-making in 
processing claims for health insurance policies.  The bill also directs the 
commissioner of insurance to maintain a public database of insurers [ health 
insurance claim denial rates and the outcomes of independent reviews of adverse 
actions under health insurance policies.
Under current law, insureds may request an independent review of adverse 
actions under a health insurance policy under certain circumstances.  The bill 
provides that an insured also has the right to request from the Office of the Public 
Intervenor created under the bill a review of any health insurance claim denial.
In addition, the bill authorizes the commissioner of insurance to audit 
insurers that deny health insurance claims with such frequency as to indicate a 
general business practice. Under the bill, the commissioner may collect any relevant 
information from an insurer necessary to conduct an audit; contract with a third 
party to conduct an audit; order an insurer to comply with a corrective action plan 
based on the findings of an audit; and impose forfeitures or sanctions on an insurer 
that fails to comply with a corrective action plan.  The bill also requires insurers to 
provide a written response to any adverse findings of an audit.
Application of manufacturer discounts
Health insurance policies and plans often apply deductibles and out-of-pocket 
maximum amounts to the benefits covered by the policy or plan.  A deductible is an 
amount that an enrollee in a policy or plan must pay out of pocket before attaining 
the full benefits of the policy or plan.  An out-of-pocket maximum amount is a limit 
specified by a policy or plan on the amount that an enrollee pays, and once that 
limit is reached, the policy or plan covers the benefit entirely.  The bill requires 
health insurance policies that offer prescription drug benefits and self-insured 
health plans to apply the amount of any discounts that a manufacturer of a brand-
name drug provides to reduce the amount of cost sharing that is charged to an 
enrollee for those brand-name drugs to the enrollee [s deductible and out-of-pocket 
maximum amount.  That requirement applies for brand-name drugs that have no 
generic equivalent and for brand-name drugs that have a generic equivalent but 
that the enrollee has prior authorization or physician approval to obtain.
Fiduciary duty of pharmacy benefit managers
The bill imposes fiduciary and disclosure requirements on pharmacy benefit 
managers.  Pharmacy benefit managers contract with health plans that provide 
prescription drug benefits to administer those benefits for the plans.  They also 
have contracts with pharmacies and pay the pharmacies for providing the drugs to 
the plan beneficiaries.
The bill provides that a pharmacy benefit manager owes a fiduciary duty to a 
plan sponsor.  The bill also requires that a pharmacy benefit manager annually 
disclose all of the following information to the plan sponsor:
1.  The indirect profit received by the pharmacy benefit manager from owning 
a pharmacy or service provider.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 125 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
2.  Any payments made to a consultant or broker who works on behalf of the 
plan sponsor.
3.  From the amounts received from drug manufacturers, the amounts 
retained by the pharmacy benefit manager that are related to the plan sponsor [s 
claims or bona fide service fees.
4.  The amounts received from network pharmacies and the amount retained 
by the pharmacy benefit manager.
Licensure of pharmacy benefit management brokers and consultants
The bill requires an individual who is acting as a pharmacy benefit 
management broker or consultant or who is acting to procure the services of a 
pharmacy benefit manager on behalf of a client to be licensed by OCI.  The bill 
allows OCI to promulgate rules to establish criteria, procedures, and fees for 
licensure.
Licensure of pharmaceutical representatives
The bill requires a pharmaceutical representative to be licensed by OCI and to 
display the pharmaceutical representative [s license during each visit with a health 
care professional.  The bill defines Xpharmaceutical representative Y to mean an 
individual who markets or promotes pharmaceuticals to health care professionals 
on behalf of a pharmaceutical manufacturer for compensation.  The term of a 
license issued under the bill is one year, and the license is renewable.  Under the 
bill, the license fee is set by the commissioner of insurance.  The bill directs the 
commissioner to promulgate rules to implement the bill [s requirements, including 
rules that require pharmaceutical representatives to complete continuing 
educational coursework as a condition of licensure.  An individual who violates any 
of the requirements under the bill is subject to a fine, and the individual [s license 
may be suspended or revoked.
Pharmacy services administrative organizations
The bill requires that a pharmacy services administrative organization 
(PSAO) be licensed by OCI.  Under the bill, a PSAO is an entity operating in 
Wisconsin that does all of the following:
1.  Contracts with an independent pharmacy to conduct business on the 
pharmacy [s behalf with a third-party payer.
2.  Provides at least one administrative service to an independent pharmacy 
and negotiates and enters into a contract with a third-party payer or pharmacy 
benefit manager on the pharmacy [s behalf.
The bill defines Xindependent pharmacy Y to mean a licensed pharmacy 
operating in Wisconsin that is under common ownership with no more than two 
other pharmacies.  XAdministrative service Y is defined to mean assisting with 
claims or audits, providing centralized payment, performing certification in a 
specialized care program, providing compliance support, setting flat fees for generic 
drugs, assisting with store layout, managing inventory, providing marketing 
support, providing management and analysis of payment and drug dispensing data, 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 126 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
or providing resources for retail cash cards.  The bill defines Xthird-party payer Y to 
mean an entity operating in Wisconsin that pays or insures health, medical, or 
prescription drug expenses on behalf of beneficiaries.  The bill uses the current law 
definition of Xpharmacy benefit manager, Y which is an entity doing business in 
Wisconsin that contracts to administer or manage prescription drug benefits on 
behalf of an insurer or other entity that provides prescription drug benefits to 
Wisconsin residents.
To obtain the license required by the bill, a person must apply to OCI and 
provide the contact information for the applicant and a contact person, evidence of 
financial responsibility of at least $1,000,000, and any other information required 
by the commissioner of insurance.  Under the bill, the license fee is set by the 
commissioner, and the term of a license is two years.
The bill also requires that a PSAO disclose to OCI the extent of any ownership 
or control by an entity that provides pharmacy services; provides prescription drug 
or device services; or manufactures, sells, or distributes prescription drugs, 
biologicals, or medical devices.  The PSAO must notify OCI within five days of any 
material change in its ownership or control related to such an entity.
Moneys from pharmacy benefit manager regulation used for general 
program operations
The bill credits to the appropriation account for OCI [s general program 
operations all moneys received from the regulation of pharmacy benefit managers, 
pharmacy benefit management brokers, pharmacy benefit management 
consultants, pharmacy services administration organizations, and pharmaceutical 
representatives.
Insurer network adequacy standards
The bill allows OCI to promulgate rules to establish minimum network time 
and distance standards and minimum network wait-time standards for defined 
network plans and preferred provider plans.  The bill specifies that OCI, in 
promulgating rules under the bill, must consider standards adopted by the federal 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for qualified health plans offered on 
the federally facilitated health insurance marketplace established pursuant to the 
ACA.
State-based exchange
The bill directs OCI to establish and operate a state-based health insurance 
exchange.  Under current law, the ACA requires that an exchange be established in 
each state to facilitate the purchase of qualified health insurance coverage by 
individuals and small employers.  Under the ACA, a state must operate its own 
state-based exchange, use the federally facilitated exchange operated by the federal 
Department of Health and Human Services, or adopt a hybrid approach under 
which the state operates a state-based exchange but uses the federal platform, 
known as HealthCare.gov, to handle eligibility and enrollment functions.  
Wisconsin currently uses the federally facilitated exchange.  The bill directs OCI to 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 127 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
establish and operate a state-based exchange, first by using the federal platform 
and then transitioning to a fully state-run exchange.  The bill authorizes OCI to 
enter into any agreement with the federal government necessary to implement 
those provisions.  The bill also requires that OCI impose a user fee on insurers 
offering plans through the state-based exchange.  Under current law, the ACA 
imposes user fees on insurers offering plans through federally facilitated exchanges 
and state-based exchanges using the federal platform, which are currently 1.5 
percent and 1.2 percent of total monthly premiums, respectively.  The bill 
authorizes OCI to impose a user fee at the following rates:
1.  For any plan year that OCI operates the state-based exchange using the 
federal platform, the rate is 0.5 percent.
2.  For the first two plan years that OCI operates the fully state-run exchange, 
the rate is equal to the user fee for the federally facilitated exchanges.  For later 
plan years, the rate is set by OCI by rule.
The bill creates an annual GPR appropriation for OCI [s general program 
operations.  Further, the bill allows OCI to spend up to $500,000 in fiscal year 
2025]26 and up to $500,000 in fiscal year 2026 ]27 for the development of a public 
option health insurance plan.
Telehealth parity
The bill requires health insurance policies and self-insured governmental 
health plans to cover a treatment or service that is provided through telehealth if 
the treatment or service is covered by the policy or plan when provided in person.  A 
policy or plan may limit its coverage to those treatments or services that are 
medically necessary.  XTelehealth Y is defined in the bill as a practice of health care 
delivery, diagnosis, consultation, treatment, or transfer of medically relevant data 
by means of audio, video, or data communications that are used either during a 
patient visit or consultation or are used to transfer medically relevant data about a 
patient.
The bill also sets parameters on the coverage of telehealth treatments and 
services that is required in the bill.  A policy or plan may not subject a telehealth 
treatment or service to a greater deductible, copayment, or coinsurance than if 
provided in person.  Similarly, a policy or plan may not impose a policy or calendar 
year or lifetime benefit limit or other maximum limitation or a prior authorization 
requirement on a telehealth treatment or service that is not imposed on treatments 
or services provided through manners other than telehealth.  A policy or plan also 
may not place unique location requirements on a telehealth treatment or service.  If 
a policy or plan covers a telehealth treatment or service that has no in-person 
equivalent, the policy or plan must disclose this in the policy or plan materials.
Short-term, limited duration plan coverage requirements
The bill sets certain coverage requirements on individual health plans that 
are short-term, limited duration plans.  Under current law, a short-term, limited 
duration plan is individual health benefit plan coverage that is marketed and 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 128 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
designed to provide short-term coverage as a bridge between other coverages and 
that has a term of not more than 12 months and an aggregate term of all 
consecutive periods of coverage that does not exceed 18 months.  Under current law, 
an insurer generally must renew individual health coverage at the option of the 
insured, but an insurer is not required to renew a short-term, limited duration 
plan.
The bill requires an insurer that offers a short-term, limited duration plan to 
accept every individual who applies for coverage, regardless of whether the 
individual has a preexisting condition.  The bill also prohibits a short-term, limited 
duration plan from imposing a preexisting condition exclusion.  Under current law, 
a short-term, limited duration plan may impose a preexisting condition exclusion, 
but the plan must reduce the length of time of the exclusion by the aggregate 
duration of the insured [s consecutive periods of coverage.  Under current law, a 
preexisting condition exclusion is a period of time during which a plan will not cover 
a medical condition for which the insured received some medical attention before 
the effective date of coverage.
Under the bill, an insurer that offers a short-term, limited duration plan may 
not vary premium rates for a specific plan except on the basis of 1) whether the plan 
covers an individual or a family; 2) the area in the state; 3) age; and 4) tobacco use, 
as specified in the bill.  An insurer that offers a short-term, limited duration plan is 
prohibited under the bill from establishing rules for the eligibility of any individual 
to enroll based on certain health status-related factors, which are specified in the 
bill, and from requiring an enrollee to pay a greater premium, contribution, 
deductible, copayment, or coinsurance amount than is required of a similarly 
situated enrollee based on a health status-related factor.  Under the bill, a short-
term, limited duration plan may not establish lifetime limits or limits for the 
duration of the coverage on the dollar value of benefits for an enrollee or a 
dependent of an enrollee under the plan.
Finally, the bill reduces the maximum allowable term of a short-term, limited 
duration plan from 12 months to three months and reduces the maximum 
aggregate duration from 18 months to six months.
Special enrollment period for pregnancy
The bill requires health insurance plans and self-insured governmental health 
plans to allow a pregnant individual who is eligible for coverage under the plan, and 
any individual who is eligible for coverage because of a relationship to the pregnant 
individual, to enroll in the plan at any time during the pregnancy.  Under the bill, 
the coverage must begin no later than the first day of the first calendar month in 
which the pregnant individual receives medical verification of the pregnancy, 
except that the pregnant individual may direct coverage to begin on the first day of 
any month occurring during the pregnancy.  The bill also requires that insurers 
offering group health insurance coverage notify individuals of the special 
enrollment period at or before the time the individual is initially offered the 
opportunity to enroll in the plan.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Coverage of infertility services
The bill requires health insurance policies and self-insured governmental 
health plans that cover medical or hospital expenses to cover diagnosis of and 
treatment for infertility and standard fertility preservation services.  Coverage 
required under the bill must include at least four completed egg retrievals with 
unlimited embryo transfers, in accordance with certain guidelines, and single 
embryo transfer when recommended and medically appropriate.  Policies and plans 
may not impose an exclusion, limitation, or other restriction on the coverage 
required under the bill on the basis that an insured person participates in fertility 
services provided by or to a third party.  Policies and plans are also prohibited from 
imposing an exclusion, limitation, or other restriction on coverage of medications for 
which the bill requires coverage that is not imposed on any other prescription 
medications covered under the policy or plan.  Similarly, policies and plans may not 
impose any exclusion, limitation, cost-sharing requirement, benefit maximum, 
waiting period, or other restriction on diagnosis, treatment, or services for which 
coverage is required under the bill that is different from any exclusion, limitation, 
cost-sharing requirement, benefit maximum, waiting period, or other restriction 
imposed on benefits for other services.
Coverage of over-the-counter oral contraceptives
Under current law, every health insurance policy and every self-insured 
governmental health plan that covers outpatient health care services, preventive 
treatments and services, or prescription drugs and devices must provide coverage 
for contraceptives prescribed by a health care provider.  Under the bill, these 
insurance policies and health plans must also provide coverage of oral 
contraceptives that are lawfully furnished over the counter without a prescription.
Reimbursement to federal drug pricing program participants
The bill prohibits any person from reimbursing certain entities that 
participate in the federal drug pricing program, known as the 340B Program, for a 
drug subject to an agreement under the program at a rate lower than that paid for 
the same drug to pharmacies that have a similar prescription volume.  The bill also 
prohibits a person from imposing any fee, charge back, or other adjustment on the 
basis of the entity [s participation in the 340B Program.  The entities covered by the 
prohibitions under the bill are federally qualified health centers, critical access 
hospitals, and grantees under the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, as well 
as these entities [ pharmacies and any pharmacy with which any of the entities have 
contracted to dispense drugs through the 340B Program.  The bill allows the 
commissioner of insurance to promulgate rules to establish minimum 
reimbursement rates for entities that participate in the 340B Program.
Reimbursement for emergency ambulance services under health insurance 
policies and plans
The bill makes several changes to the coverage and reimbursement of 
emergency ambulance services under health insurance policies and plans.  First, 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 130 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
the bill requires defined network plans, preferred provider plans, and self-insured 
governmental plans that provide coverage of emergency medical services to cover 
emergency ambulance services provided by an ambulance service provider that is 
not a participating provider at a rate that is the greatest of 1) a rate that is set or 
approved by a local governmental entity in the jurisdiction in which the emergency 
ambulance services originated; 2) a rate that is 400 percent of the current published 
rate for the provided emergency ambulance services established by the federal 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the Medicare program in the same 
geographic area or a rate that is equivalent to the rate billed by the ambulance 
service provider for emergency ambulance services provided, whichever is less; or 
3) the contracted rate at which the defined network plan, preferred provider plan, or 
self-insured governmental plan would reimburse a participating ambulance service 
provider for the same emergency ambulance services.  The bill prohibits any 
defined network plan, preferred provider plan, or self-insured governmental plan 
from imposing a cost-sharing amount on an enrollee for emergency ambulance 
services provided by an ambulance service provider that is not a participating 
provider at a rate that is greater than the requirements that would apply if the 
emergency ambulance services were provided by a participating ambulance service 
provider.  The bill provides that no ambulance service provider that receives 
reimbursement as provided in the bill may charge an enrollee for any additional 
amount for emergency ambulance services except for any copayment, coinsurance, 
deductible, or other cost-sharing responsibilities required to be paid by the enrollee.  
Finally, the bill provides that any health insurance policy or self-insured 
governmental health plan must respond to claims for covered emergency 
ambulance services within 30 days after receipt of the claim and, if the claim is 
without defect, promptly remit payment for the covered emergency ambulance 
services directly to the ambulance service provider.  If the claim has a defect, the 
bill instead requires the health insurance policy or self-insured governmental 
health plan to provide a written notice to the ambulance service provider within 30 
days after receipt of the claim.
Coverage of treatment or services provided by qualified treatment trainees
The bill prohibits any health insurance plan from excluding coverage for 
mental health or behavioral health treatment or services provided by a qualified 
treatment trainee within the scope of the qualified treatment trainee [s education 
and training if the health insurance plan covers the mental health or behavioral 
health treatment or services when provided by another health care provider.  
XQualified treatment trainee Y is defined under current law to mean either a 
graduate student who is enrolled in an accredited institution in psychology, 
counseling, marriage and family therapy, social work, nursing, or a closely related 
field or a person with a graduate degree from an accredited institution and course 
work in psychology, counseling, marriage and family therapy, social work, nursing, 
or a closely related field who has not yet completed the applicable supervised 
practice requirements described under the administrative code.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Coverage of treatment or services provided by substance abuse counselors
The bill prohibits any health insurance plan from excluding coverage for 
alcoholism or other drug abuse treatment or services provided by a certified 
substance abuse counselor within the scope of the substance abuse counselor [s 
education and training if the health insurance plan covers the alcoholism or other 
drug abuse treatment or services when provided by another health care provider.  
XSubstance abuse counselor Y is defined under current law to mean a substance 
abuse counselor-in-training, a substance abuse counselor, or a clinical substance 
abuse counselor.
Coverage of services, treatment, or procedures provided by dental therapists
Current law prohibits any health insurance plan from excluding coverage for 
diagnosis and treatment of a condition or complaint by a dental therapist within the 
scope of the dental therapist [s license if the health insurance plan covers diagnosis 
and treatment of the condition or complaint by another health care provider.  The 
bill instead prohibits any health insurance plan from excluding coverage for dental 
services, treatment, or procedures provided by a dental therapist within the scope 
of the dental therapist [s license if the health insurance plan covers the dental 
services, treatment, or procedures when provided by another health care provider.  
XDental therapist Y is defined under current law as an individual who engages in 
the limited practice of dentistry.
Cost-sharing cap on insulin
The bill prohibits every health insurance policy and governmental self-insured 
health plan that covers insulin and imposes cost sharing on prescription drugs from 
imposing cost sharing on insulin in an amount that exceeds $35 for a one-month 
supply.  Current law requires every health insurance policy that provides coverage 
of expenses incurred for treatment of diabetes to provide coverage for specified 
expenses and items, including insulin.  The required coverage under current law for 
certain diabetes treatments other than insulin infusion pumps is subject to the 
same exclusions, limitations, deductibles, and coinsurance provisions of the policy 
as other covered expenses.  The bill [s cost-sharing limitation on insulin supersedes 
the specification that the exclusions, limitations, deductibles, and coinsurance are 
the same as for other coverage.
Insulin safety net programs
The bill requires insulin manufacturers to establish a program under which 
qualifying Wisconsin residents who are in urgent need of insulin and are uninsured 
or have limited insurance coverage can be dispensed insulin at a pharmacy.  Under 
the program, if a qualifying individual in urgent need of insulin provides a 
pharmacy with a form attesting that the individual meets the program [s eligibility 
requirements, specified proof of residency, and a valid insulin prescription, the 
pharmacy must dispense a 30-day supply of insulin to the individual and may 
charge the individual a copayment of no more than $35.  The pharmacy may submit 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 132 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
an electronic payment claim for the insulin [s acquisition cost to the manufacturer or 
agree to receive a replacement of the same insulin in the amount dispensed.
The bill also requires that each insulin manufacturer establish a patient 
assistance program to make insulin available to any qualifying Wisconsin resident 
who, among other requirements, is uninsured or has limited insurance coverage 
and whose family income does not exceed 400 percent of the federal poverty line.  
Under the bill, an individual must apply to participate in a manufacturer [s 
program.  If the manufacturer determines that the individual meets the program [s 
eligibility requirements, the manufacturer must issue the individual a statement of 
eligibility, which is valid for 12 months and may be renewed.  Under the bill, if an 
individual with a statement of eligibility and valid insulin prescription requests 
insulin from a pharmacy, the pharmacy must submit an order to the manufacturer, 
who must then provide a 90-day supply of insulin at no charge to the individual or 
pharmacy.  The pharmacy may charge the individual a copayment of no more than 
$50.  Under the bill, a manufacturer is not required to issue a statement of 
eligibility if the individual has prescription drug coverage through an individual or 
group health plan and the manufacturer determines that the individual [s insulin 
needs are better addressed through the manufacturer [s copayment assistance 
program.  In such case, the manufacturer must provide the individual with the 
necessary drug coupons, and the individual may not be required to pay more than a 
$50 copayment for a 90-day supply of insulin.
Under the bill, if the manufacturer determines that an individual is not 
eligible for the patient assistance program, the individual may file an appeal with 
OCI.  The bill directs OCI to establish procedures for deciding appeals.  Under the 
bill, OCI must issue a decision within 10 days, and that decision is final.
The bill requires that insulin manufacturers annually report to OCI certain 
information, including the number of individuals served and the cost of insulin 
dispensed under the programs and that OCI annually report to the governor and 
the legislature on the programs.  The bill also directs OCI to conduct public 
outreach and develop an information sheet about the programs, conduct 
satisfaction surveys of individuals and pharmacies that participate in the 
programs, and report to the governor and the legislature on the surveys by July 1, 
2028.  Additionally, the bill requires that OCI develop a training program for health 
care navigators to assist individuals in accessing appropriate long-term insulin 
options and maintain a list of trained navigators.
The bill provides that a manufacturer that violates the bill [s provisions may be 
required to forfeit not more than $200,000 per month of violation, which increases 
to $400,000 per month if the manufacturer continues to be in violation after six 
months and to $600,000 per month if the manufacturer continues to be in violation 
after one year.  The bill [s requirements do not apply to manufacturers with annual 
insulin sales revenue in Wisconsin of no more than $2,000,000 or to insulin that 
costs less than a specified dollar amount.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Value-based diabetes medication pilot project
The bill directs OCI to develop a pilot project under which a pharmacy benefit 
manager and a pharmaceutical manufacturer are directed to create a value-based, 
sole-source arrangement to reduce the costs of prescription diabetes medication.  
The bill allows OCI to promulgate rules to implement the pilot project.
Funding for health insurance navigators
The bill directs the commissioner of insurance to award $500,000 in fiscal year 
2025-26 and $500,000 in fiscal year 2026-27 to a licensed navigator to prioritize 
services for the direct care workforce population.  Navigators are individuals or 
entities that perform certain duties, including conducting public education 
activities to raise awareness of the availability of qualified health plans, 
distributing fair and impartial information concerning enrollment in qualified 
health plans, facilitating enrollment in qualified health plans, and providing 
referrals for any enrollee with a grievance, complaint, or question regarding their 
health plan, coverage, or a determination under such plan or coverage.
Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan balance transfer
The Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan (HIRSP) provided health insurance 
coverage in individual policies to certain eligible individuals, including individuals 
who were refused coverage in the private health insurance market because of their 
mental or physical condition.  HIRSP was dissolved and, by March 31, 2014, all 
coverage under HIRSP was finally terminated.  2015 Wisconsin Act 55 repealed two 
appropriations to OCI that provided funding for the affairs of HIRSP and for 
winding up the affairs of HIRSP.  The bill transfers any balance that was credited to 
those appropriations and not lapsed as a result of 2015 Wisconsin Act 55 to the 
general program operations appropriation for OCI in fiscal year 2025-26.
Wisconsin Healthcare Stability Plan spending limit
Under current law, the Wisconsin Healthcare Stability Plan (WIHSP) makes a 
reinsurance payment to a health insurance carrier if the claims for an individual 
who is enrolled in a health benefit plan with that carrier exceed a threshold amount 
in a benefit year.  WIHSP is administered by OCI and operates under specific terms 
and conditions of a waiver agreement between OCI and the federal Department of 
Health and Human Services, which was dated July 29, 2018, and extended 
December 1, 2022.  Currently, the commissioner of insurance is limited to spending 
$230,000,000 for WIHSP from all revenue sources in a year, unless JCF increases 
the amount.  Under the bill, the governor, not JCF, may increase the spending limit.  
In addition, the bill increases the spending limit to $250,000,000 in 2026, and 
beginning in 2027, the bill directs the commissioner to annually adjust the 
spending limit based on the increase, if any, in the medical care index of the 
consumer price index.  The bill also specifies that OCI [s authority includes the 
authority to operate WIHSP under any waiver extension approvals.
JUSTICE
Powers of the attorney general
The bill repeals changes made to the powers of the attorney general in 2017 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 134 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
Wisconsin Act 369 relating to the power to compromise or discontinue civil actions 
prosecuted by DOJ and the power to compromise and settle actions in cases where 
DOJ is defending the state.  The bill reestablishes these settlement powers as they 
existed under the law before 2017 Wisconsin Act 369 was enacted.
The bill allows the attorney general to compromise or discontinue actions 
prosecuted by DOJ 1) when directed by the officer, department, board, or 
commission that directed the prosecution or 2) with the approval of the governor 
when the action is prosecuted by DOJ on the initiative of the attorney general or at 
the request of any individual.  The bill eliminates the requirement for approval of a 
compromise or discontinuance from a legislative intervenor or JCF.  It also 
eliminates the requirement for the attorney general to obtain approval of a 
compromise or discontinuance by the Joint Committee on Legislative Organization 
(JLCO) in certain circumstances before submitting a proposed plan to JCF.
Under the bill, when DOJ is defending the state, the attorney general may 
compromise and settle the action as the attorney general determines to be in the 
best interest of the state.  The bill eliminates the requirement under current law 
that, in actions for injunctive relief or if there is a proposed consent decree, the 
attorney general must 1) obtain the approval of any legislative intervenor or 2) if 
there is no intervenor, submit a proposed plan to JCF and, in certain 
circumstances, obtain approval of JCF.  The bill also eliminates the requirement for 
the attorney general to obtain approval from JCLO in certain circumstances before 
submitting a proposed plan of settlement or compromise to JCF.
Crime victim services grants
Current law provides for a number of surcharges that a court must impose on 
a person who is found to have committed crimes or violated ordinances.  The bill 
creates a new crime victim services surcharge and requires a court to impose the 
surcharge when imposing a sentence, a period of probation, or a civil forfeiture on a 
person.  The amount of the surcharge is the sum of 40 percent of any fine or 
forfeiture imposed or $40, whichever is greater, plus $50 for each conviction of a 
misdemeanor or felony.
The bill requires DOJ to use the funds collected from the surcharge to award 
grants to organizations that are eligible for federal funds to provide crime victim 
assistance.  The grants from DOJ are intended to supplement any federal funds.  In 
addition, the bill authorizes DOA to supplement the funds available for the grants 
if DOA determines that the amounts available are insufficient for crime victim 
services.  Under the bill, if DOA determines the amounts available are insufficient, 
the amount that may be supplemented is capped at the difference between 
$44,500,000 and the sum of the federal funds received in that fiscal year for crime 
victim assistance plus the funds collected in that fiscal year from the crime victim 
services surcharge created in the bill.
Alternatives to prosecution and incarceration programs
Under current law, DOJ operates the alternatives to incarceration grant 
program and the drug courts grant program.  Under these programs, DOJ provides 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 135 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
grants to counties and tribes for providing alternatives to prosecution and 
incarceration for persons who abuse alcohol or other drugs and diverting substance-
abusing persons from prison or jail into treatment.
Under the bill, December 31, 2026, is the last day these DOJ grant programs 
will be in effect.  Beginning on January 1, 2027, DOA will operate a grant program 
for tribes to provide alternatives to prosecution and incarceration programs, and 
counties will be required to operate such programs to be eligible for certain circuit 
court payments from the director of state courts.
The bill also transfers 3.0 FTE GPR positions that administer the alternatives 
to incarceration grant program, and the incumbent employees holding those 
positions, from DOJ to the Wisconsin Supreme Court on January 1, 2027.
Eliminating the sunset on funding for the Office of School Safety
2023 Wisconsin Act 240 increased the number of positions for the Office of 
School Safety (OSS) in DOJ by 14.2 project positions for the period beginning on 
January 1, 2025, and ending on October 1, 2025, and allowed, for the same period, 
DOJ to fund the positions and other OSS duties using the fees that DOJ collects for 
issuing licenses to carry concealed weapons.  The bill eliminates the sunset on using 
the fees so that DOJ may continue using the fees to fund positions and other OSS 
duties.
Law enforcement officer training requirements
The bill provides that the Law Enforcement Standards Board may not prevent 
noncitizens who are in receipt of valid employment authorization from the federal 
Department of Homeland Security from participating in a law enforcement 
preparatory training program.
Project employees of DOJ offices under ARPA
The bill provides that individuals who are in project positions that were 
funded by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and who are employed by DOJ 
may be appointed to equivalent permanent positions at DOJ without going through 
the civil service hiring process as new hires.
Appropriation for restitution moneys
The bill makes a technical change to DOJ [s restitution appropriation to 
provide that it also includes all moneys received by DOJ under any other 
unspecified court order or settlement agreement for the purpose of providing 
restitution to victims.
Project attorney reporting requirement
2017 Wisconsin Act 261 created two field prosecutor attorney project positions 
to assist DOJ [s Division of Criminal Investigation and provided that those positions 
would terminate five years after the effective date of the act.  The act also created a 
requirement that DOJ submit an annual report to JCF describing the activities and 
effectiveness of those field prosecutor attorneys.  Those positions have expired.
The bill eliminates the reporting requirement relating to those expired field 
prosecutor attorney project positions.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Law enforcement officer training reimbursement
The bill makes a technical change relating to the appropriations from which 
reimbursements for law enforcement officer training are paid.
Relator appropriation
The bill creates a continuing appropriation to hold all moneys received by DOJ 
that is owed to a relator, to provide payments to relators.  A relator is a type of party 
in a legal action in whose name an action is brought by a state.
Gifts and grants and disposition of settlement funds
The bill repeals certain changes made by 2017 Wisconsin Act 369 relating to 
gifts and grants and certain proceeds received by DOJ, specifically reversing 
provisions that changed a DOJ gifts and grants appropriation and a DOJ gifts, 
grants, and proceeds appropriation from continuing appropriations to annual 
appropriations.
The bill also repeals the requirement that the attorney general must deposit 
all settlement funds into the general fund.  The bill restores procedures relating to 
discretionary settlement funds under which the attorney general could expend 
certain settlement funds not committed under the terms of a settlement after 
submitting a plan to JCF for passive review only if either 1) the cochairpersons of 
JCF do not schedule a meeting or 2) a meeting is scheduled and JCF approves a 
plan for expenditure.

GENERAL  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT
Local landlord-tenant ordinances
Current law prohibits political subdivisions from enacting certain ordinances 
relating to landlords and tenants.  Political subdivisions may not do any of the 
following:
1.  Prohibit or limit landlords from obtaining or using certain information 
relating to a tenant or prospective tenant, including monthly household income, 
occupation, rental history, credit information, court records, and social security 
numbers.
2.  Limit how far back in time a landlord may look at a prospective tenant [s 
credit information, conviction record, or previous housing.
3.  Prohibit or limit a landlord from entering into a rental agreement with a 
prospective tenant while the premises are occupied by a current tenant.
4.  Prohibit or limit a landlord from showing a premises to a prospective tenant 
during a current tenant [s tenancy.
5.  Place requirements on a landlord with respect to security deposits or 
earnest money or inspections that are in addition to what is required under 
administrative rules.
6.  Limit a tenant [s responsibility for any damage to or neglect of the premises.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 137 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
7.  Require a landlord to provide to tenants or to the political subdivision any 
information that is not required to be provided under federal or state law.
8.  Require a residential property to be inspected except under certain 
circumstances.
9.  Impose an occupancy or transfer of tenancy fee on a rental unit.
Current law also prohibits political subdivisions from regulating rent 
abatement in a way that permits abatement for conditions other than those that 
materially affect the health or safety of the tenant or that substantially affect the 
use and occupancy of the premises.  The bill eliminates all of these prohibitions.
Local moratorium on evictions
Current law prohibits political subdivisions from imposing a moratorium on 
landlords from pursuing eviction actions against a tenant.  The bill eliminates that 
prohibition.
Rental property inspection requirements
The bill makes various changes to the requirements relating to inspections of 
rental properties.  The bill eliminates existing limitations on inspection fees that 
political subdivisions may charge for rental property inspections.  Under the bill, a 
landlord must provide notice to a tenant of an impending inspection in the same 
manner the landlord would provide notice under current law to enter for repairs or 
to show the property to prospective tenants.  The bill also provides that rental 
property inspection fees charged by a political subdivision are not subject to 
deduction from the political subdivision [s tax levy.
Local government civil service system and grievance procedure 
requirements
The bill modifies the requirements for any grievance system established by 
local governmental units, including adding a requirement for any civil service 
system or grievance procedure to include a just cause standard of review for 
employee terminations.  Under current law, a local governmental unit that did not 
have a civil service system before June 29, 2011, must have established a grievance 
system.  In order to comply with the requirement to have established a grievance 
system, a local governmental unit may establish either 1) a civil service system 
under any provision authorized by law, to the greatest extent practicable, if no 
specific provision for creation of a civil service system applies to the governmental 
unit or 2) a grievance procedure as set forth in the statutes.  Current law requires 
that any civil service system established or grievance procedure created must 
contain a grievance procedure that addresses employee terminations, employee 
discipline, and workplace safety.  The bill does not eliminate the requirement for 
these provisions but instead adds a requirement for a provision relating to a just 
cause standard of review for employee terminations, including a refusal to renew a 
teaching contract.
Current law also requires that if a local governmental unit creates a grievance 
procedure, the procedure must contain certain elements, including a written 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 138 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
document specifying the process that a grievant and an employer must follow; a 
hearing before an impartial hearing officer; and an appeal process in which the 
highest level of appeal is the governing body of the local governmental unit.  The bill 
provides that the hearing officer must be from the Wisconsin Employment 
Relations Commission and adds the following two additional required elements in 
the grievance procedure:  1) a provision indicating the grievant is entitled to 
representation throughout the grievance process and 2) a provision indicating that 
the employer must bear all fees and costs related to the grievance process, except 
the grievant [s representational fees and costs.
Local employment regulations
The bill eliminates the preemptions of local governments from enacting or 
enforcing ordinances related to the following:
1.  Regulations related to wage claims and collections.
2.  Regulation of employee hours and overtime, including scheduling of 
employee work hours or shifts.
3.  The employment benefits an employer may be required to provide to its 
employees.
4.  An employer [s right to solicit information regarding the salary history of 
prospective employees.
5.  Regulations related to minimum wage.
6.  Occupational licensing requirements that are more stringent than a state 
requirement.
Certain state and local employment regulations
The bill eliminates the following:
1.  The prohibition of the state and local governments from requiring any 
person to waive the person [s rights under state or federal labor laws as a condition 
of any approval by the state or local government.
2.  A provision under which neither the state nor a local government may 
enact a statute or ordinance, adopt a policy or regulation, or impose a contract, 
zoning, permitting, or licensing requirement, or any other condition, that would 
require any person to accept any provision that is a subject of collective bargaining 
under state labor laws or the federal National Labor Relations Act.
Project labor agreements
Under current law, the state and local units of government are prohibited from 
engaging in certain practices in letting bids for state procurement or public works 
contracts. Among these prohibitions, the state and local governments may not do 
any of the following in specifications for bids for the contracts: 1) require that a 
bidder enter into an agreement with a labor organization; 2) consider, when 
awarding a contract, whether a bidder has or has not entered into an agreement 
with a labor organization; or 3) require that a bidder enter into an agreement that 
requires that the bidder or bidder [s employees become or remain members of a labor 2025 - 2026  Legislature

organization or pay any dues or fees to a labor organization.  The bill eliminates 
these limitations related to labor organizations.
Exception to local law enforcement officer citizenship requirement
Under current law, no person may be appointed as a deputy sheriff of any 
county or police officer of any city, village, or town unless that person is a citizen of 
the United States.  The bill allows the sheriff of a county or the appointing 
authority of a local law enforcement agency to elect to authorize the appointment of 
noncitizens who are in receipt of valid employment authorization from the federal 
Department of Homeland Security as deputy sheriffs or police officers.  The bill 
also prevents the Law Enforcement Standards Board from preventing such a 
noncitizen from participating in a law enforcement preparatory training program.
Register of deeds recording fees; land information program
The bill increases the general recording and filing fees charged by county 
registers of deeds, increases the amount of the fees that counties must submit to 
DOA for the land information program, and increases the minimum grant amount 
DOA may award to counties for education and training grants under the program.
Under current law, DOA directs and supervises the land information program 
and serves as a state clearinghouse for access to land information.  Under the land 
information program, DOA provides technical assistance to state agencies and local 
governmental units with land information responsibilities, reviews and approves 
county plans for land records modernization, and provides aids to counties, derived 
from recording fee revenues collected by counties, for land records modernization 
projects.
Under current law, counties collect fees for recording or filing instruments 
that are recorded or filed with a register of deeds.  Currently, the general fee for 
recording or filing an instrument is $30.  Currently, a county must submit $15 of 
each $30 recording fee to DOA for the land information program, but the county 
may retain $8 of the amount it would have been required to submit to DOA if the 
county meets certain requirements, including establishing a land information office 
and council and using the retained fees to develop, implement, and maintain a 
DOA-approved countywide plan for land records modernization on the Internet.
The bill increases from $30 to $45 the general recording and filing fee.  The bill 
also increases from $15 to $30 the amount of each fee that a county must submit to 
DOA and increases from $8 to $15 the amount the county may retain if the current 
law requirements are met.
Under current law, DOA awards land information system base budget grants 
to counties to enable county land information offices to develop, maintain, and 
operate basic land information systems.  Currently, the minimum amount of a 
grant is $100,000 less the amount of certain fees retained by the county in the 
preceding fiscal year.  The bill increases that base amount to $140,000 less the 
retained fees.
Under current law, DOA may award a grant under the land information 2025 - 2026  Legislature

program to any county in an amount not less than $1,000 per year to be used for the 
training and education of county employees for the design, development, and 
implementation of a land information system.  The bill increases from $1,000 to 
$5,0000 the minimum training and education grant amount.
Municipal records filings and filing requirements for certain annexations
The bill transfers the duty of filing certain municipal records from the 
secretary of state to the secretary of administration and transfers certain records 
held by the secretary of state to instead be held by DOA.  2015 Wisconsin Act 55 
transferred some, but not all, municipal records filing duties from the secretary of 
state to DOA.  The bill completes the transfer of these duties from the secretary of 
state to DOA for all municipal filing categories.
The bill also replaces the term XplatY with the term Xscale map Y in certain 
filing statutes to conform with existing statutory requirements for certain filings, 
including petitions for incorporation and for annexation.  The bill reduces the 
number of copies that must be provided to DOA in certain circumstances from 
multiple copies to just one copy.  The bill also requires that certain boundary 
agreements between municipalities be filed and recorded with the register of deeds 
if an enacting ordinance is not anticipated to be enacted within 30 days.
Local advisory referenda
Under current law, a county may not conduct a countywide advisory 
referendum unless it regards a political subdivision revenue sharing agreement or 
capital expenditures proposed to be funded by the county property tax levy. In 
addition, current law prohibits a municipality from conducting an advisory 
referendum unless it regards tax incremental financing, a local government 
telecommunications utility, or capital expenditures proposed to be funded by the 
municipality [s property tax levy.
The bill eliminates these restrictions and specifically authorizes a county to 
conduct referenda for advisory purposes.
Provision and funding of emergency medical services by towns
The bill authorizes a town to contract for or maintain emergency medical 
services for the town.  The bill also authorizes a town to do any of the following for 
the purpose of funding these emergency medical services:
1. Appropriate money.
2.  Charge property owners a fee for the cost of emergency medical services 
provided to their property according to a written schedule established by the town 
board.
3.  Levy taxes on the entire town.
4.  Levy taxes on property served by a particular source of emergency medical 
services, to support the source of emergency medical services.2025 - 2026  Legislature

LEVY LIMITS
Levy limits under current law
Generally, under current law, local levy increase limits are applied to the 
property tax levies that are imposed by a political subdivision in December of each 
year.  Current law prohibits any political subdivision from increasing its levy by a 
percentage that exceeds its valuation factor.  XValuation factor Y is defined as the 
greater of either 0 percent or, in general, the percentage change in the political 
subdivision [s equalized value due to new construction, less improvements removed.
Current law contains a number of exceptions to the local levy limits, such as 
amounts a county levies for a countywide emergency medical system, for a county 
children with disabilities education board, and for certain bridge and culvert 
construction and repair.  In addition, a political subdivision may exceed the levy 
increase limit that is otherwise applicable if its governing body adopts a resolution 
to do so and if that resolution is approved by the electors in a referendum.
Levy limit reduction for service transfers
Under current law, if a political subdivision transfers to another governmental 
unit the responsibility to provide a service that it provided in the previous year, the 
levy increase limit otherwise applicable in the current year is decreased to reflect 
the cost that the political subdivision would have incurred to provide that service.  
The bill eliminates that provision.
Joint emergency services levy limit exception modification
Among the current law exceptions to local levy limits is an exception for the 
amount that a municipality levies to pay for charges assessed by a joint fire 
department or joint emergency medical services district organized by any 
combination of two or more municipalities.  This exception applies only to the 
extent that the amount levied to pay for such charges would cause the municipality 
to exceed the otherwise applicable levy limit and only if the charges assessed by the 
joint fire department or joint emergency medical services district increase in the 
current year by an amount not greater than the rate of inflation over the preceding 
year, plus 2 percent, and if the municipality [s governing body adopts a resolution in 
favor of exceeding the otherwise applicable levy limit.
Under the bill, the exception is expanded to include joint fire services or joint 
emergency medical services provided by a combination of two or more 
municipalities through a joint district, joint ownership, joint purchase of services 
from a nonprofit corporation, or joint contracting with a public or private services 
provider.  The exception is also expanded to cover all fees charged to a municipality 
by the joint fire services or joint emergency medical services.
Levy limit exclusion for cross-municipality transit routes
Under the bill, amounts levied by a political subdivision for costs related to 
new or enhanced transit services that cross adjacent county or municipal borders do 
not apply to the local levy limits if the political subdivisions between which the 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 142 - LRB-2080/1

routes operate have entered into an agreement to provide for the services and if the 
agreement is approved in a referendum.
Levy limit exception for regional planning commission contributions
The bill creates a local levy increase limit exception for the amount a political 
subdivision levies to pay for the political subdivision [s share of the budget of a 
regional planning commission (RPC).  An RPC [s budget is determined annually by 
the RPC.  The RPC then charges all political subdivisions within its jurisdiction a 
proportional amount to fund the budget based on the equalized value of property in 
the political subdivision and the total amount of equalized value of property within 
the RPC [s jurisdiction.
TAX INCREMENTAL  FINANCING
Tax incremental financing under current law
Under current law, cities and villages may use tax incremental financing 
(TIF) to encourage development in the city or village.  In general, under TIF, a city 
or village pays for improvements in a tax incremental district (TID) and then 
collects tax moneys attributable to all taxing jurisdictions on the increased 
property value in the TID for a certain period of time to pay for the improvements.  
Ideally, after the period of time, the city or village will have been repaid for its 
initial investment, and the property tax base in the TID will have permanently 
increased in value.
In general and in brief, a city or village makes use of TIF using the following 
procedure:
1.  The city or village designates an area as a TID and creates a project plan 
laying out the expenditures that the city or village will make within the TID.
2.  DOR establishes the Xbase value Y of the TID.  This value is the equalized 
value of all taxable property within the TID at the time of its creation.
3.  Each year thereafter, the Xvalue increment Y of the property within the TID 
is determined by subtracting the base value from the current value of property 
within the TID.  The portion of taxes collected on any positive value increment is 
collected by the city or village for use solely for the project costs of the TID.  The 
taxes collected by the city or village on positive value increments include taxes that 
would have been collected by other taxing jurisdictions, such as counties or school 
districts, were the TID not created.
4.  Tax increments are collected until the city or village has recovered all of its 
project costs or until the TID reaches its statutory termination date.
Workforce housing initiatives
The bill authorizes workforce housing initiatives and makes changes that 
affect TIDs and state housing grants.  The bill creates a definition for Xworkforce 
housing, Y changes the definition of a Xmixed-use development Y TID, requires a 
TID[s project plan to contain alternative economic projections, and changes the 
method of imposing certain impact fees.
Under the bill, a political subdivision may put into effect a workforce housing 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 143 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
initiative by taking one of several specified actions and posting on its website an 
explanation of the initiative.  Workforce housing initiatives include the following: 
reducing permit processing times or impact fees for workforce housing; increasing 
zoning density for a workforce housing development; rehabilitating existing 
uninhabitable housing stock into habitable workforce housing; or implementing 
any other initiative to address workforce housing needs.  Once an initiative takes 
effect, it remains in effect for five years.  After June 30, 2026, if a political 
subdivision has in effect at least three initiatives at the same time, DOA must give 
priority to housing grant applications from, or related to a project in, the political 
subdivision.
The bill defines Xworkforce housing Y to mean both of the following, subject to 
the five-year average median costs as determined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census:
1.  Housing that costs a household no more than 30 percent of the household [s 
gross median income.
2.  Housing that is comprised of residential units for initial occupancy by 
individuals whose household median income is no more than 120 percent of the 
county[s gross median income.
Under current law, a mixed-use development TID contains a combination of 
industrial, commercial, or residential uses, although newly platted residential 
areas may not exceed more than 35 percent of the real property within the TID.  
Under the bill, newly platted residential areas may not exceed either the 35 percent 
limit or 60 percent of the real property within the TID if the newly platted 
residential use that exceeds 35 percent is used solely for workforce housing.
The bill also requires a TID [s project plan to include alternative projections of 
the TID[s finances and feasibility under different economic situations, including a 
slower pace of development and lower rate of property value growth than expected 
in the TID.
Currently, a city or village may extend the life of a TID for up to one year for 
housing stock improvement if all of the following occurs:
1.  The city or village pays off all of the TID [s project costs.
2.  The city or village adopts a resolution stating that it intends to extend the 
life of the TID, the number of months it intends to do so, and how it intends to 
improve housing stock.
3.  The city or village notifies DOR.
Current law requires the city or village to use 75 percent of the tax increments 
received during the period specified in the resolution to benefit affordable housing 
in the city or village and 25 percent to improve the city [s or village [s housing stock.
Under the bill, a city or village may extend the life of a TID to improve its 
housing stock or to increase the number of affordable and workforce housing 
improvements, with at least 50 percent of the funds supporting units for families 
with incomes of up to 60 percent of the county [s median income.  Also under the bill, 
this extension may be for up to three years.  However, for any extension of more 
than one year, the other taxing jurisdictions must approve of the extension.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 144 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
Under current law, if a city, village, or town imposes an impact fee on a 
developer to pay for certain capital costs to accommodate land development, the 
city, village, or town may provide in the ordinance an exemption from, or a 
reduction in the amount of, impact fees on land development that provides low-cost 
housing.  Under the bill, the impact fee exemption or reduction provisions also apply 
to workforce housing.  Current law prevents the shifting of an exemption from or 
reduction in impact fees to any other development in the land development in which 
the low-cost housing is located.  The bill applies this provision to workforce housing 
as well.
Reclassification of TID to mixed-use TID
When a TID is created, the city or village must designate the TID as one of 
several sorts of TID: blighted area, rehabilitation or conservation, industrial, or 
mixed-use.  The application of certain rules vary depending on the classification of 
the TID.  For example, blighted area TIDs have a longer potential lifespan than 
industrial or mixed-use TIDs.
Under the bill, a city or village may change the classification of a TID to a 
mixed-use TID after the creation of the TID.  The TID would retain the lifespan and 
tax collection features of the original classification but would gain the features of a 
mixed-use TID.  The principal difference between mixed-use TIDs and other TIDs is 
the ability within certain limits to spend tax increments on newly platted 
residential development.
TIF 12 percent rule exception
Under current law, when creating a new TID or amending a TID, a city or 
village must make a finding that the equalized value of taxable property of the new 
or amended TID plus the value increment of all existing TIDs in the city or village 
does not exceed 12 percent of the total equalized value of taxable property in the 
city or village.  Under the bill, in lieu of making the 12 percent finding, a city or 
village may certify to DOR that 1) TIDs with sufficient value increments will close 
within one year after certification so that the city or village will no longer exceed 
the 12 percent limit and 2) the city or village will not take any actions that would 
extend the life of any TID under item 1.
MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION AND REGULATION
Under the bill, a person who is at least 21 years old may legally possess 
marijuana.  A person who is at least 18 may possess marijuana if the person has 
certain medical conditions.  Under the bill, a person may produce, process, or sell 
marijuana if the person has a permit.  The bill creates an excise tax for the privilege 
of producing, processing, distributing, or selling marijuana in this state.  All of the 
revenue collected from the tax is deposited into the general fund.  Under the bill, a 
person who may possess medical marijuana is not subject to sales or excise taxes on 
the purchase or use of the marijuana.  The bill also regulates delta-8 THC and 
delta-10 THC as marijuana.  The bill does not affect federal law, which generally 
prohibits persons from manufacturing, delivering, or possessing marijuana and 
applies to both intrastate and interstate violations.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 145 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
Legalizing the possession of marijuana
Current law prohibits a person from manufacturing, distributing, or 
delivering marijuana; possessing marijuana with the intent to manufacture, 
distribute, or deliver it; possessing or attempting to possess marijuana; using drug 
paraphernalia; or possessing drug paraphernalia with the intent to produce, 
distribute, or use a controlled substance.  The bill changes state law to allow a 
Wisconsin resident who is at least 21 to possess no more than two ounces of 
marijuana and to allow a nonresident of Wisconsin who is at least 21 to possess no 
more than one-quarter ounce of marijuana.  The bill also allows a qualifying patient 
to possess marijuana for medical purposes.  Under the bill, generally, a qualifying 
patient is an individual who has been diagnosed by a physician as having or 
undergoing a debilitating medical condition or treatment and who is at least 18 
years old.  The bill also eliminates the prohibition on possessing or using drug 
paraphernalia that relates to marijuana consumption.
Under the bill, a person who possesses more marijuana than the maximum 
amount the person is allowed is subject to a penalty, which varies depending on the 
amount of overage.  A person who exceeds the amount by not more than one ounce 
is subject to a civil forfeiture not to exceed $1,000.  A person who exceeds the 
maximum amount by more than one ounce is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject 
to a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 90 days or both.  
The person is guilty of a Class I felony if the person also takes action to hide the 
amount of marijuana they have and has in place a security system to alert them to 
the presence of law enforcement or a method to intimidate, or a system that could 
injure or kill, a person approaching the area containing the marijuana.
Regulating the production, processing, and selling marijuana
Under the bill, no person may sell, distribute, or transfer marijuana unless the 
person has a permit from DOR.  A person that violates this prohibition is guilty of a 
Class I felony if the intended recipient is an adult and is guilty of a Class H felony if 
the intended recipient is a minor and the person is at least three years older than 
the minor.
The bill requires a person to obtain separate permits from DOR to produce, 
process, distribute, or sell marijuana, and requires marijuana producers and 
processors to obtain additional permits from DATCP.  The requirements for 
obtaining these permits differ based on whether the permit is issued by DOR or 
DATCP but, in general, a person may not obtain such a permit if they are not a state 
resident, are under the age of 21, or have been convicted of certain crimes or 
committed certain offenses.  In addition, a person may not operate under a DOR or 
DATCP permit within 500 feet of a school, playground, recreation facility, child care 
facility, public park, public transit facility, or library.  A person that holds a permit 
from DOR must also comply with certain operational requirements.
Under the bill, a permit applicant with 20 or more employees may not receive 
a permit from DATCP or DOR unless the the applicant certifies that the applicant 
has entered into a labor peace agreement with a labor organization.  The labor 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 146 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
peace agreement must prohibit the labor organization and its members from 
engaging in any economic interference with persons doing business in this state, 
must prohibit the applicant from disrupting the efforts of the labor organization to 
communicate with and to organize and represent the applicant [s employees, and 
must provide the labor organization access to areas in which the employees work to 
discuss employment rights and the terms and conditions of employment.  Current 
law prohibits the state and any local unit of government from requiring a labor 
peace agreement as a condition for any regulatory approval.  The permit 
requirements under the bill are not subject to that prohibition.
The bill also requires DATCP and DOR to use a competitive scoring system to 
determine which applicants are eligible to receive permits.  Each department must 
issue permits to the highest scoring applicants that it determines will best protect 
the environment; provide stable, family-supporting jobs to local residents; ensure 
worker and consumer safety; operate secure facilities; and uphold the laws of the 
jurisdictions in which they operate.  Each department may deny a permit to an 
applicant with a low score.
The bill prohibits a DOR permittee from selling, distributing, or transferring 
marijuana to a person who is under the age of 21 (a minor) and from allowing a 
minor to be on premises for which a permit is issued.  If a permittee violates one of 
those prohibitions, the permittee may be subject to a civil forfeiture of not more 
than $500 and the permit may be suspended for up to 30 days.
Under the bill, a minor who does any of the following is subject to a forfeiture 
of not less than $250 nor more than $500: procures or attempts to procure 
marijuana from a permittee; falsely represents their age to receive marijuana from 
a permittee; knowingly possesses marijuana; or knowingly enters any premises for 
which a permit has been issued without being accompanied by their parent, 
guardian, or spouse who is at least 21 years of age or at least 18 years of age if a 
qualifying patient.
Under the bill, an individual may cultivate as many as six marijuana plants.  
Only a person that has a permit from DATCP may produce or process more 
marijuana plants.  A person without a permit who possesses more than six but not 
more than 12 marijuana plants that have reached the flowering stage is subject to 
a civil forfeiture not to exceed twice the permitting fee, which is $250 under the bill.  
If the person possesses more than 12 plants that have reached the flowering stage, 
the person is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000 or 
imprisonment not to exceed 90 days or both.  The person is guilty of a Class I felony 
if the person also takes action to hide the number of plants they have and the 
person also has in place a security system to alert him or her to the presence of law 
enforcement or a method to intimidate, or a system that could injure or kill, a

is a person who is at least 18 and has been diagnosed by a physician as having a 
debilitating medical condition such as cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, or another specified 
condition or is undergoing a debilitating medical treatment.
Previous convictions relating to marijuana
The bill creates a process to review convictions for acts that have been 
decriminalized under the bill.  If the person is currently serving a sentence or on 
probation for such a conviction, the person may petition a court to dismiss the 
conviction and expunge the record.  If the person has completed a sentence or period 
of probation for such a conviction, the person may petition a court to expunge the 
record or, if applicable, redesignate it to a lower crime.  Any conviction that is 
expunged under the bill is not considered a conviction for any purpose under state 
or federal law.
Registration for THC testing labs
The bill requires DATCP to register entities as tetrahydrocannabinols (THC)-
testing laboratories.  The laboratories must test marijuana for contaminants; 
research findings on the use of medical marijuana; and provide training on safe and 
efficient cultivation, harvesting, packaging, labeling, and distribution of marijuana, 
security and inventory accountability, and research on medical marijuana.
Discrimination based on marijuana use
Under the fair employment law, no employer or other person may engage in 
any act of employment discrimination against any individual on the basis of the 
individual [s use or nonuse of lawful products off the employer [s premises during 
nonworking hours, subject to certain exceptions, one of which is if the use impairs 
the individual [s ability to undertake adequately the job-related responsibilities of 
that individual [s employment.  The bill specifically defines marijuana as a lawful 
product for purposes of the fair employment law, such that no person may engage in 
any act of employment discrimination against an individual because of the 
individual [s use of marijuana off the employer [s premises during nonworking hours, 
subject to those exceptions.
Under current law, an individual may be disqualified from receiving 
unemployment insurance benefits if they are terminated because of misconduct or 
substantial fault.  The bill specifically provides that an employee [s use of marijuana 
off the employer [s premises during nonworking hours does not constitute 
misconduct or substantial fault unless termination for that use is permitted under 
one of the exceptions under the fair employment law.
Unless federal law requires otherwise, the bill prohibits a hospital, physician, 
organ procurement organization, or other person from determining the ultimate 
recipient of an anatomical gift on the sole basis of a positive test for the use of 
marijuana by a potential recipient.
Drug screening and testing
The bill exempts THC, including marijuana, from drug testing for certain 2025 - 2026  Legislature

public assistance programs.  Currently, a participant in a community service job or 
transitional placement under the Wisconsin Works program (W2) or a recipient of 
the FoodShare program, also known as the food stamp program, who is convicted of 
possession, use, or distribution of a controlled substance must submit to a test for 
controlled substances as a condition of continued eligibility.  DHS is currently 
required to request a waiver of federal Medicaid law to require drug screening and 
testing as a condition of eligibility for the childless adult demonstration project in 
the Medical Assistance program.  Current law also requires DHS to promulgate 
rules to develop and implement a drug screening, testing, and treatment policy for 
able-bodied adults without dependents in the FoodShare employment and training 
program.  The bill exempts THC from all of those drug-testing requirements and 
programs.  In addition, because THC is not a controlled substance under state law 
under the bill, the requirement under current law that DCF promulgate rules to 
create a controlled substance abuse screening and testing requirement for 
applicants for the work experience program for noncustodial parents under W2 and 
the Transform Milwaukee Jobs and Transitional Jobs programs does not include 
THC.
Under current law, DWD must establish a program to test claimants who 
apply for unemployment insurance (UI) benefits for the presence of controlled 
substances, as defined under federal law.  If a claimant tests positive for a 
controlled substance, the claimant may be denied UI benefits, subject to certain 
exceptions and limitations.  The bill excludes THC for purposes of this testing 
requirement.  As such, under the bill, an individual who tests positive for THC may 
not be denied UI benefits.
MILITARY AFFAIRS
Tuition grant program for national guard members 
The bill makes changes to DMA [s tuition grant program relating to the grant 
amount awarded to national guard members for higher education as well as the 
name of the grants.
Under current law, DMA awards tuition grants to eligible national guard 
members enrolled in qualifying schools, which include public and private 
institutions of higher education.  The amount of the tuition grant payment is equal 
to 100 percent of the actual tuition charged by the guard member [s school or 100 
percent of the maximum resident undergraduate tuition charged by the UW-
Madison for a comparable number of credits, whichever amount is less.
The bill specifies that, in calculating the amount of tuition charged by a 
qualifying school, the amount includes tuition and segregated fees if the school is a 
UW System institution and includes program fees and incidental fees if the school 
is a technical college.  The bill also renames grants awarded under the program as 
Xeducational grants Y rather than Xtuition grants. Y  The bill further specifies that, 
subject to exceptions, if an eligible guard member receives an educational grant, no 
other award of financial aid to the guard member may be reduced because of the 
educational grant.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Under current law, DMA operates a grant program to reimburse incumbent 
local exchange carriers operating as originating service providers for costs 
associated with Next Generation 911.  Currently, no moneys may be encumbered 
from the appropriation that funds the grant program after June 30, 2027.  The bill 
removes the June 30, 2027, end date for encumbering funds under the grant 
program.
Costs eligible for disaster assistance payment grants
Under current law, DMA may make payments from state disaster assistance 
appropriation accounts to eligible local governmental units for costs that are a 
direct result of certain disasters, including eligible costs of debris removal; certain 
emergency protective measures for the protection of life, public health, and 
property; and certain damage to roads and bridges.  The bill directs that the costs 
eligible for such payments include certain categories of work designated by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency [s public assistance program, including 
the program [s Category D, regarding water control facilities; Category E, regarding 
public buildings and contents; Category F, regarding public utilities; and Category 
G, regarding parks, recreation, and other facilities.
Under current law, DMA may also make payments from a state disaster 
assistance appropriation account to local governmental units for the damages and 
costs incurred as the result of a disaster if 1) the disaster is not eligible for other 
funding related to a presidentially declared Xmajor disaster, Y or 2) DMA determines 
the disaster does not meet a certain per capita impact indicator.  Additionally, the 
local governmental unit receiving the payment must pay for 30 percent of the 
amount of damages and costs resulting from the disaster.  The bill requires DMA to 
provide a $68,100 payment in fiscal year 2025 ]26 from the same state disaster 
assistance appropriation account to the Town of Westport, exempts the payment 
from the program [s eligibility requirement, and exempts the town from the 30 
percent payment requirement.

FORESTRY
Managed forest land fees
Under current law, DNR administers the managed forest land (MFL) 
program, under which the owner of a parcel of land designated as MFL makes an 
annual acreage share payment in lieu of property taxes. In exchange, the owner 
must comply with certain forestry practices and, subject to exceptions, must open 
the land to the public for recreational activities.  Certain actions relating to a parcel 
designated as MFL must be recorded by the appropriate register of deeds and DNR 
must pay any required fee for the recording. 
Under current law, MFL may be transferred from one owner to another with 
payment of a $100 fee, which is deposited in the conservation fund.  Of that amount, 
$20 is credited to a DNR appropriation for the payment of register of deed fees.  
Land may also be withdrawn from the MFL program with payment of a $300 fee. 
Under the bill, $100 transfer fees and $300 withdrawal fees are deposited in 
the conservation fund and credited to the DNR appropriation for the payment of 
fees to the registers of deeds.
Wildfire suppression reimbursement
Under current law, DNR administers the fire suppression aids program, 
which provides grants to counties, cities, villages, towns, and fire suppression 
organizations to assist with the cost of training and supplies for fire suppression.  
The bill appropriates to DNR, from the conservation fund, a sum sufficient to 
reimburse local fire departments under the program.

Transfer to forestry account
The bill modifies the amount of GPR to be transferred to the conservation 
fund for forestry purposes.  Under current law, an amount equal to 0.1697 mills for 
each dollar of equalized property value in the state is transferred.  The bill modifies 
the amount of the transfer to 0.1406 mills for each dollar of equalized property 
value in the state.  Current law requires funds transferred in this manner to be 
used for acquiring, preserving, and developing the forests of the state and for 
various other purposes related to forestry.

increases the bonding authority for these projects by $15,000,000.
RECREATION
Outdoor skills training program
The bill changes which appropriation from the conservation fund pays for an 
outdoor skills training program.  Under current law, the UW System must enter

to persons who are interested in learning about the outdoor skills needed by women 
to hunt, fish, camp, canoe, and undertake other outdoor recreational activities in 
order to provide that type of training to interested persons.
Free admission to state parks for fourth graders
Under current law, no person may operate a vehicle in any state park or in 
certain other recreational areas on state land unless the vehicle displays a vehicle 
admission receipt.  The bill requires DNR to waive the fee for an annual vehicle 
admission receipt issued to the parent or guardian of a pupil receiving a fourth 
grade level of instruction.  A parent or guardian of a qualifying pupil may apply to 
DNR for the waiver by submitting required certifications.  A parent or guardian 
may receive the waiver only once in his or her lifetime and DNR may issue a waiver 
only once for a household.
State park admission and camping fee waivers for tribal members
The bill requires DNR to waive the fee for an annual vehicle admission receipt 
issued to a member of a federally recognized American Indian tribe or band located 
in this state.  Under current law generally, no person may operate a vehicle in any 
state park or in certain other recreational areas on state land unless the vehicle

GENERAL  NATURAL  RESOURCES
Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship 2000 Program
The bill reauthorizes the Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship 2000 
Program (stewardship program) until 2036 and makes various changes to the 
program.
Current law authorizes the state to incur public debt for certain conservation 
activities under the stewardship program, which is administered by DNR.  The 
state may incur this debt to acquire land for the state for conservation purposes and 
for property development activities and may award grants or state aid to certain 
local governmental units and nonprofit conservation organizations (NCOs) to 
acquire land for these purposes.  Current law establishes the amounts that DNR 
may obligate in each fiscal year through fiscal year 2025 ]26 for expenditure under 
each of five subprograms of the stewardship program.
The bill increases the total amount that may be obligated for the stewardship 
program from $33,250,000 each fiscal year to $83,000,000 each fiscal year 
beginning with fiscal year 2026 ]27 and ending with fiscal year 2035 ]36.
Moneys obligated under the stewardship program are appropriated from the 
capital improvement fund (CIF) and stewardship bond proceeds are deposited into 
CIF.  Current law provides that, in obligating moneys under the subprogram for 
land acquisition, DNR must set aside certain amounts to be obligated only for DNR 
to acquire land and to provide grants to counties for land acquisition (county forest 
grants).  Specifically, the set-aside for DNR land acquisition each fiscal year is 
$1,000,000 plus the amount transferred to CIF under an appropriation that 
transfers from moneys received for forestry activities (the forestry account) to CIF 
$5,000,000 in each fiscal year.  The set-aside for county forest grants is equal to the 
amount transferred to CIF under an appropriation that transfers from the forestry 
account to CIF $3,000,000 in each fiscal year.  The bill ends these annual transfers 
from the forestry account to CIF beginning in fiscal year 2026 ]27 and replaces the 
corresponding set-aside requirements under the land acquisition subprogram with 
appropriations that directly fund those purposes from the conservation fund, not 
the stewardship program.  Specifically, the bill appropriates $6,000,000 each fiscal 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 155 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
year from the conservation fund for DNR land acquisitions and $3,000,000 each 
fiscal year from the forestry account for county forest grants.  The $6,000,000 that 
the bill appropriates directly each fiscal year for DNR land acquisitions is 
$1,000,000 more than the amount currently transferred to CIF and set aside for 
this purpose, and in addition the bill continues to provide a $1,000,000 set-aside for 
this purpose under the land acquisition subprogram of the stewardship program.  
The bill provides that any amount in CIF remaining from the amounts transferred 
from the forestry account in fiscal years 2022 ]23, 2023 ]24, 2024 ]25, and 2025 ]26 is 
transferred back to the forestry account in fiscal year 2026 ]27.
The bill eliminates a current law provision that states that, of the amount set 
aside under the land acquisition subprogram for DNR to acquire land, DNR may 
not use more than one-third to acquire land in fee simple.  In addition, the bill 
eliminates a provision requiring DNR to use at least two appraisals to determine 
the current fair market value of land that is the subject of a stewardship funding for 
an NCO or governmental unit if DNR estimates the fair market value of the land to 
exceed $350,000.  The bill increases from $7,000,000 to $14,000,000 the amount 
under the land acquisition subprogram that must be set aside for grants to 
nonprofit conservation organizations each fiscal year.
The bill renames the property development and local assistance subprogram 
to be the Xstate property development and local parks and recreation subprogram, Y 
and increases from $14,250,000 to $51,500,000 the amount in each fiscal year that 
may be obligated under the subprogram.  Of that amount, the bill increases from 
$5,000,000 to $15,450,000 the amount that DNR must obligate for property 
development each fiscal year and increases from $9,250,000 to $36,050,000 the 
amount that DNR must obligate for local assistance each fiscal year.
The bill increases from $500,000 to $2,500,000 the amount that DNR is 
required to set aside each fiscal year, from the amounts obligated for property 
development, for grants to friends groups and NCOs for property development 
activities on DNR properties.  The bill also increases from $20,000 to $50,000 the 
maximum amount that DNR may encumber per DNR property for these grants in 
each fiscal year.
The bill creates a motorized recreation grant program funded from 
stewardship moneys, under which DNR may award a grant to a county, city, village, 
town, or recreational vehicle club either to acquire land for the purpose of 
establishing an all-terrain vehicle trail, off-highway motorcycle trail, or snowmobile 
trail (treated as obligated from the land acquisition subprogram) or to construct a 
trail crossing for an all-terrain vehicle trail, off-highway motorcycle trail, or 
snowmobile trail as part of an interchange project (treated as obligated from the 
state property development and local parks and recreation subprogram).  The bill 
requires DNR to allocate $5,000,000 in each fiscal year for these grants.
The bill renames the recreational boating aids subprogram to be the Xlocal 
recreation boat facilities subprogram Y and increases from $3,000,000 to $9,000,000 
the amount in each fiscal year that DNR may obligate under the subprogram.  The 
bill eliminates DNR [s authority under current law to use funds, whether 
stewardship or other funds, for recreational boating project feasibility studies.  The 2025 - 2026  Legislature

bill changes one of the factors that DNR must consider in establishing priorities for 
projects from Xprojects underway Y to Xprojects in a state of readiness. Y
The bill creates two new programs and funds them with appropriations from 
the general fund.  Specifically, the bill creates a grant program for nonprofit 
conservation organizations to support wildlife and habitat management, and a 
tribal co-management program under which DNR must coordinate with the 
federally recognized American Indian tribes or bands domiciled in this state in the 
management of education infrastructure, land management activities, and other 
activities on DNR land.
Nonprofit conservation organization grants
Under current law, DNR is authorized to provide grants to nonprofit 
conservation organizations for a variety of conservation purposes, including 
acquisition of property, encouraging land management activities that enhance the 
state[s natural resources, and providing technical assistance.
The bill creates an appropriation to DNR from the general fund for the 
purpose of providing grants to nonprofit conservation organizations and requires 
DNR to award grants in the 2025 ]26 fiscal year to the following organizations: 1) 
Gathering Waters, 2) the Natural Resources Foundation of Wisconsin, 3) River 
Alliance of Wisconsin, and 4) Wisconsin Lakes.
Building demolition
The bill creates a continuing appropriation from the general fund to DNR for 
the demolition of buildings on DNR-owned property.
Wild rice stewardship
The bill appropriates to DNR from the general fund moneys for wild rice 
stewardship efforts within the waters of areas where American Indian tribes or 
bands hold treaty-based rights to harvest wild rice.  The bill provides that not less 
than $50,000 of the amounts appropriated for each fiscal year must be allocated for 
public education and outreach pertaining to wild rice harvesting.
Off-highway motorcycle sales tax collection
Under current law, 1 percent of sales and use taxes on all-terrain vehicles, 
utility terrain vehicles, boats, and snowmobiles are deposited in the segregated 
conservation fund.  The bill provides that 1 percent of sales and use taxes on off-
highway motorcycles are deposited in the conservation fund and credited to the 
DNR appropriation for off-highway motorcycle administration.
Funding from Indian gaming receipts
Current law and Indian gaming compacts require DOA to transfer portions of 
Indian gaming receipts to certain DNR appropriations annually. At the end of each 
fiscal year, unobligated funds from programs that receive tribal gaming revenues 
revert to the appropriation account to which Indian gaming receipts are credited.
The bill eliminates the requirement to transfer these amounts to an 
appropriation that funds snowmobile law enforcement operations and safety 
training and fatality reporting and eliminates that appropriation.  The bill also 
creates a new appropriation to DNR for providing grants to federally recognized 2025 - 2026  Legislature

Lake Superior Chippewa based on the amount of fees collected by DNR for certain 
hunting and fishing approvals and the number of certain approvals issued within 
the the Lac du Flambeau reservation. DNR makes this payment from an 
appropriation that receives tribal gaming revenues.  The bill provides that this 
appropriation is subject to the same reversion requirement as other gaming receipts 
transfers to DNR.
PUBLIC UTILITIES
Funding for broadband expansion grant program
The bill appropriates GPR funding for the broadband expansion grant 
program administered by PSC.
Focus on Energy funding
The bill makes changes to the funding of statewide energy efficiency and 
renewable resources programs, known as Focus on Energy, that current law 
requires investor-owned electric and natural gas utilities to fund.  Under the bill, 
PSC must require those utilities to spend 2.4 percent of their annual operating 
revenues derived from retail sales to fund Focus on Energy and related programs.  
Under current law, the amount those utilities must spend is 1.2 percent of their 
annual operating revenues from retail sales.
Focus on Energy residential customer energy storage
The bill includes residential energy storage system programs and programs 
for reducing energy demand in the Focus on Energy program.
Energy innovation grant program
The bill appropriates GPR for the energy innovation grant program (EIGP), 
which is administered by PSC [s Office of Energy Innovation and awards grants for 
projects related to energy efficiency and innovation.  Currently, the EIGP is funded 
with federal money from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
Residential and commercial energy improvements
The bill allows PSC to authorize a public utility to finance energy 
improvements at a specific dwelling for a residential or commercial customer.  
Under the bill, a public utility may recover the costs of such an energy improvement 
through a surcharge periodically placed on the customer [s account.  The bill 
requires PSC to promulgate rules establishing requirements for this financing, 
which must include that the surcharge is assigned to a location, not to an individual 
customer; that energy improvements are eligible for financing only if they are 
estimated to save an amount that exceeds the surcharge; and that the financing 
offered may not increase a customer [s risk or debt.

a CPCN to the applicant.  However, current law also allows the PSC chairperson to 
extend that deadline for no more than an additional 180 days.  If PSC fails to take 
final action within the extended deadline, PSC is considered to have issued the 
CPCN.  The bill authorizes the PSC chairperson to make two such 180-day 
extensions instead of just one.
Brownfield renewable energy generation grants
Under the bill, PSC makes grants to developers and electric providers for 
redeveloping brownfields for renewable energy generation.  The grants may be used

brownfields, and technical support.
Nuclear energy feasibility study
The bill requires PSC to conduct a nuclear power plant feasibility study and 
creates an appropriation to fund the study.
Electric utility integrated resource plans
The bill requires investor-owned and municipal electric utilities to file 
integrated resource plans with PSC.  An integrated resource plan must describe the 
resources an electric utility could use to meet the service needs of its customers over 
the next 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year periods and must contain certain other 
information, including forecasts of electricity demand under various reasonable 
scenarios and plans and projected costs for meeting that electricity demand.  PSC 
must establish requirements for the contents and filing of the plans, and PSC must 
approve, reject, or modify an electric utility [s integrated resource plan consistent 
with the public interest.  The bill also requires PSC to review the integrated 
resource plans filed by electric utilities to inform its biennial strategic energy 
assessment.  Under current law, the strategic energy assessment evaluates the 
adequacy and reliability of the state [s current and future energy supply.
Securitization of retiring power plants
Under current law, an energy utility is allowed to apply to PSC for an order 
allowing the utility to finance the costs of the following activities by issuing bonds: 
1) the construction, installation, or otherwise putting into place of environmental 
control equipment in connection with a plant that, before March 30, 2004, has been 
used to provide service to customers and 2) the retiring of any existing plant, 
facility, or other property to reduce, control, or eliminate environmental pollution in 
accordance with federal or state law.  Current law defines these activities as 
Xenvironmental control activities. Y  If approved by PSC, the bonds, which are 
referred to as Xenvironmental trust bonds, Y are secured by revenues arising from 
charges paid by an energy utility [s customers for the utility to recover the cost of the 
activities, as well as the cost of financing the bonds.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 159 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
The bill adds the retiring of any existing electric generating facility fueled by 
nonrenewable combustible energy resources as an environmental control activity, 
the costs of which may be financed by an environmental trust bond.
Remove size limit on grants for lead service line replacement
The bill allows water public utilities to make grants that cover the full cost of 
replacing lead-containing customer-side water service lines.  Under current law, 
water public utilities may, after applying to and receiving approval from PSC, make 
grants and loans to property owners to assist replacement of customer-side water 
service lines containing lead.  Current law prohibits PSC from approving a water 
public utility [s application to provide these grants unless grants are limited to no 
more than one-half of the total cost of replacing lead-containing customer-side 
water service lines.
REAL ESTATE
Real estate condition reports
Under current law, with certain exceptions, an owner selling residential real 
property or vacant land must give a prospective buyer a form, known as a real 
estate condition report for residential real property and known as the vacant land 
disclosure report for vacant land (real estate condition report), on which the owner 
discloses certain conditions of, and other information about, the real property of 
which the owner is aware.  Currently, as part of the real estate condition report, a 
seller must disclose whether the applicable real estate is located in a floodplain.  
The bill requires the real estate condition report to include a link to a DNR website 
for more information about flood insurance.  Current law also requires a seller of 
residential real estate to indicate whether any insurance claims related to damage 
to the premises have been filed in the past five years.  The bill adds the same 
provision to the vacant land disclosure report.  Additionally, the bill adds to both 
real estate condition reports language that specifies that the disclosure related to 
insurance claims includes insurance claims for damage caused by a flood.  Lastly, 
the bill adds to the real estate condition report a disclosure related to claims for 
financial support, other than insurance claims, for damage to the property caused 
by a flood.  Under current law and the bill, the real estate condition report includes 
a provision under which the prospective buyer acknowledges that that technical 
knowledge such as that acquired by professional inspectors may be required to 
detect certain defects, including Xfloodplain status. Y
Landlord notification requirements
The bill provides that, if a landlord has actual knowledge that a rental 
property is located in a floodplain, the landlord must disclose that fact to a 
prospective tenant before entering into a lease or accepting any earnest money or 
security deposit from the prospective tenant. 
RETIREMENT AND GROUP INSURANCE
Benefits for domestic partners
The bill provides that domestic partners of public employees be treated 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 160 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
similarly to spouses of public employees for purposes of benefits received through 
ETF.  These benefits include group health insurance coverage, beneficiary rights 
under the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS), automatic beneficiary rights 
under the deferred compensation plan, and duty disability survivorship benefits.
WRS annuitants returning to work
Under current law, if a WRS annuitant, or a disability annuitant who has 
attained his or her normal retirement date, is appointed to a position with a WRS-
participating employer or provides employee services to a WRS-participating 
employer in which he or she is expected to work at least two-thirds of what is 
considered full-time employment by ETF, the annuity must be suspended and no 
annuity payment is payable until after the participant again terminates covered 
employment.
The bill removes the requirement that an annuitant who returns to work for a 
participating employer have his or her annuity suspended and become a 
participating employee and instead allows an annuitant who returns to work to 
either 1) elect to suspend his or her annuity and become a participating employee or 
2) elect to continue receiving his or her annuity and not become a participating 
employee.
Under current law, a WRS participant who has applied to receive a retirement 
annuity must wait at least 75 days between terminating covered employment with 
a WRS employer and returning to covered employment again as a participating 
employee.  The bill reduces that period to 30 days.
Waiting period for state employees
Under current law, most state employees, other than limited-term employees, 
become covered under the state group health insurance plan on the first day of the 
first month after becoming employed with the state by filing an election within 30 
days of being hired.  However, most state employees are ineligible for an employer 
contribution toward the premiums for the first three months of employment.  The 
bill changes the date to the first day of the second month for most state employees, 
other than limited-term employees, hired after the effective date of the bill.
Internal auditor
The bill creates the Office of Internal Audit attached to ETF.  Under the bill, 
the office plans and conducts audits of activities and programs administered by 
ETF, among other responsibilities, while following policies, principles, and 
directives established by the Employee Trust Funds Board (ETFB).
The bill requires ETFB to appoint an internal auditor and internal audit staff 
within the classified service who report directly to ETFB.  Currently, the internal 
auditor for ETF reports to the secretary of ETF, and internal audit staff report to 
the internal auditor.
Automated operating system progress report
The bill requires the secretary of ETF to submit with ETF [s biennial budget 
request a report that includes details of ETF [s expenditures to implement an 2025 - 2026  Legislature

SAFETY AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
ADVANCED  PRACTICE  REGISTERED  NURSES
Licensure of advanced practice registered nurses
Under current law, a person who wishes to practice professional nursing must 
be licensed by the Board of Nursing as a registered nurse (RN).  The bill creates an 
additional system of licensure for advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), to 
be administered by the board.  Under the bill, in order to apply for an APRN license, 
a person must 1) hold, or concurrently apply for, an RN license; 2) have completed 
an accredited graduate-level or postgraduate-level education program preparing 
the person to practice as an APRN in one of four recognized roles and hold a current 
national certification approved by the board; 3) possess malpractice liability 
insurance as provided in the bill; 4) pay a fee determined by DSPS; and 5) satisfy 
certain other criteria specified in the bill.  The bill also allows a person who has not 
completed an accredited education program described above to receive an APRN 
license if the person 1) on January 1, 2026, is both licensed as an RN in Wisconsin 
and practicing in one of the four recognized roles and 2) satisfies additional practice 
or education criteria established by the board.  The bill also, however, automatically 
grants licenses to certain RNs, as further described below.  The four recognized 
roles, as defined in the bill, are 1) certified nurse-midwife; 2) certified registered 
nurse anesthetist; 3) clinical nurse specialist; and 4) nurse practitioner.  The bill 
requires the board, upon granting a person an APRN license, to also grant the 
person one or more specialty designations corresponding to the recognized role or 
roles for which the person qualifies.
Under the bill, all APRNs, except APRNs with a certified nurse-midwife 
specialty designation, must practice in collaboration with a physician or dentist.  
However, under the bill, an APRN may practice without being supervised by a 
physician or dentist if the board verifies that the APRN has completed 3,840 hours 
of professional nursing in a clinical setting and has completed 3,840 clinical hours of 
advanced practice registered nursing practice in his or her recognized role while 
working with a physician or dentist during those 3,840 hours of practice.  APRNs 
may count additional hours practiced as an APRN in collaboration with a physician 
or dentist towards the 3,840 required hours of professional nursing.  APRNs with a 
certified nurse-midwife specialty designation are instead required, if they offer to 
deliver babies outside of a hospital setting, to file and keep current with the board a 
proactive plan for involving a hospital or a physician who has admitting privileges 
at a hospital in the treatment of patients with higher acuity or emergency care 
needs, as further described below.  Regardless of whether an APRN has qualified to 
practice independently, the bill provides that an APRN may provide chronic pain 
management services only while working in a collaborative relationship with a 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 162 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
physician who, through education, training, and experience, specializes in pain 
management.  Alternatively, if an APRN has qualified to practice independently 
and currently has privileges in a hospital, the APRN may provide chronic pain 
management services without a collaborative relationship with a physician.
The holder of an APRN license may append the title XA.P.R.N. Y to his or her 
name, as well as a title corresponding to whichever specialty designations that the 
person possesses.  The bill prohibits any person from using the title XA.P.R.N., Y and 
from otherwise indicating that he or she is an APRN, unless the person is licensed 
by the board as an APRN.  The bill also prohibits the use of titles and abbreviations 
corresponding to a recognized role unless the person has a specialty designation for 
that role.
The bill allows an APRN to delegate a task or order to another clinically 
trained health care worker if the task or order is within the scope of the APRN [s 
practice, the APRN is competent to perform the task or issue the order, and the 
APRN has reasonable evidence that the health care worker is minimally competent 
to perform the task or issue the order under the circumstances.  The bill requires an 
APRN to adhere to professional standards when managing situations that are 
beyond the APRN [s expertise.
Under the bill, when an APRN renews his or her APRN license, the board 
must grant the person the renewal of both the person [s RN license and the person [s 
APRN license.  The bill requires all APRNs to complete continuing education 
requirements each biennium in clinical pharmacology or therapeutics relevant to 
the APRN [s area of practice and to satisfy certain other requirements when 
renewing a license.
Practice of nurse-midwifery
The bill eliminates licensure and practice requirements specific to nurse-
midwives and the practice of nurse-midwifery, including specific requirements to 
practice with an obstetrician.  Under the bill, Xcertified nurse-midwife Y is one of the 
four recognized roles for APRNs, and a person who is licensed as a nurse-midwife 
under current law is automatically granted an APRN license with a certified nurse-
midwife specialty designation.  The bill otherwise allows nurse-midwives to be 
licensed as APRNs if they satisfy the licensure requirements, except that the bill 
also requires that a person applying for a certified nurse-midwife specialty 
designation be certified by the American Midwifery Certification Board.  The bill 
also requires an APRN with a specialty designation as a certified nurse-midwife to 
file with the Board of Nursing, and obtain the board [s approval of, a plan for 
ensuring appropriate care or care transitions in treating certain patients if the 
APRN offers to deliver babies outside of a hospital setting.
Prescribing authority
Under current law, a person licensed as an RN may apply to the Board of 
Nursing for a certificate to issue prescription orders if the person meets certain 
requirements established by the board.  An RN holding a certificate is subject to 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 163 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
various practice requirements and limitations established by the board and must 
possess malpractice liability insurance in an amount determined by the board.
The bill eliminates certificates to issue prescription orders and generally 
authorizes APRNs to issue prescription orders.  A person who is certified to issue 
prescription orders under current law is automatically granted an APRN license 
with his or her appropriate specialty designation.  RNs who are practicing in a 
recognized role on January 1, 2026, but who do not hold a certificate to issue 
prescription orders on that date and who are granted an APRN license under the 
bill may not issue prescription orders.  As under current law, an APRN issuing 
prescription orders is subject to various practice requirements and limitations 
established by the board.
The bill eliminates a provision concerning the ability of advanced practice 
nurses who are certified to issue prescription orders and who are required to work 
in collaboration with or under the supervision of a physician to obtain and practice 
under a federal waiver to dispense narcotic drugs to individuals for addiction 
treatment.
Malpractice liability insurance
The bill requires all APRNs to maintain malpractice liability insurance in 
coverage amounts specified under current law for physicians and nurse anesthetists 
except for an APRN whose employer has in effect malpractice liability insurance 
that provides at least the same amount of coverage for the APRN.  Additionally, the 
bill requires APRNs who have qualified to practice independently and who practice 
outside a collaborative or employment relationship to participate in the injured 
patients and families compensation fund.  The injured patients and families 
compensation fund provides excess medical malpractice coverage for health care 
providers who participate in the fund and meet all other participation 
requirements, which includes maintaining malpractice liability insurance in 
coverage amounts specified under current law.
Other changes
The bill directs DHS to require a hospital that provides emergency services to 
have sufficient qualified personnel available at all times to manage the number and 
severity of emergency department cases anticipated by the location.  At a minimum, 
the bill directs DHS to require a hospital that provides emergency services to have 
on-site at least one physician who, through education, training, and experience, 
specializes in emergency medicine.
The bill makes numerous other changes throughout the statutes relating to 
APRNs, including various terminology changes.
BUILDINGS  AND SAFETY
Private on-site wastewater treatment system grants
The bill extends the grant program aiding certain persons and businesses 
served by failing private on-site wastewater treatment systems (POWTS), which 
are commonly known as septic tanks.  Under current law, the program is repealed 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 164 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
effective June 2025.  In addition, under the bill, a failing POWTS installed at least 
33 years before the submission of a grant application is eligible to receive a grant.  
Current law authorizes grants only for failing POWTS that were installed before 
July 1, 1978.
Offsetting costs of trade exams administered by third parties
The bill creates an appropriation for DSPS to reduce the cost of examinations 
required to obtain an occupational license in the building trades that are 
administered by a third party.
Combining operations and administrative services appropriations
The bill combines two program revenue appropriations for operations and 
administrative services related to DSPS [s regulation of industry, buildings, and 
safety into a single appropriation.
PROFESSIONAL  LICENSURE
DSPS renewal dates; continuing education; nursing workforce survey
Under current law, a two-year renewal period applies to many health and 
business credentials administered by DSPS or a credentialing board.  The renewal 
date for each two-year period is specified by statute.  In addition, the laws governing 
some professions specify continuing education requirements, either by statute or by 
rule, as part of credentialing renewal.
The bill eliminates statutory renewal dates for these credentials and instead 
allows DSPS, in consultation with the credentialing boards, to establish renewal 
dates.  The bill makes various changes to continuing education requirements for 
various professions to account for the flexible renewal periods allowed in the bill, 
including allowing DSPS and the credentialing boards to adjust continuing 
education requirements and to establish interim continuing education or other 
reporting requirements as needed to align with changes to renewal cycles.
Nursing refresher course tuition reimbursement program
The bill requires DSPS to establish and implement a program to reimburse 
individuals for the cost of completing a nursing refresher course offered at a 
technical college.  The reimbursement is available to individuals who are licensed 
as a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse, are under 60 years of age, and 
have not actively practiced nursing in the prior five-year period.  The bill requires 
DSPS to allocate at least $150,000 in each fiscal year for reimbursements under the 
program.
Professional licenses for certain noncitizens
Currently, federal law prohibits all but certain noncitizens from receiving any 
Xstate or local public benefit, Y which is defined to include any Xprofessional license, 
or commercial license provided by an agency of a state or local government. Y  
However, federal law allows states to explicitly allow eligibility for certain public 
benefits.  The bill allows certain individuals who are not U.S. citizens to receive any 
professional license issued in this state if they meet all other requirements or 
qualifications for the professional license.  For purposes of the bill, Xprofessional 2025 - 2026  Legislature

Statewide clinician wellness program
The bill allows DSPS to provide a statewide clinician wellness program to 
provide support to health care workers in this state in maintaining their physical 
and mental health and ensuring long-term vitality and effectiveness for their 
patients and their profession.
Reviews of criminal records
The bill requires DSPS, when conducting an investigation of the arrest or 
conviction record of a credential applicant, to obtain and review information to 
determine the circumstances of each case or offense, except that the bill allows 
DSPS, in its discretion, to complete its investigation of an arrest or conviction 
record without reviewing the circumstances of certain types of offenses specified in 
the bill.  These offenses include certain first offense operating while intoxicated and 
related violations; certain underage alcohol violations; and minor, nonviolent 
ordinance violations, as determined by DSPS.
Rules; license portability
The bill provides that DSPS or a credentialing board in DSPS may promulgate 
rules to achieve enhanced license portability to help facilitate streamlined 
pathways to licensure for internationally trained professionals and increased 
reciprocity.
Combining general operations appropriations
The bill combines five program revenue appropriations related to the 
licensing, rule-making, and regulatory functions of DSPS into a single 
appropriation.
SHARED REVENUE
County and municipal property tax freeze incentive payments
The bill provides property tax freeze incentive payments to counties and 
municipalities that do not increase their property tax levies.  Under the bill, if a 
county[s or municipality [s property tax levy is less than or equal to its property tax 
levy in the immediately preceding year, it will receive a payment equal to the sum of 
the following amounts: 1) its property tax levy multiplied by 0.03, and 2) if it 
received a property tax freeze incentive payment in the immediately preceding year, 
the amount of that payment multiplied by 1.03.  For purposes of eligibility for the 
payments, expenditures made related to annexation and service consolidation and 
unreimbursed emergency expenditures do not count as part of a county [s or 
municipality [s property tax levy.
Payments to counties and municipalities for nontaxable tribal land
The bill provides payments to counties and municipalities to compensate for 
not being able to impose local general property taxes on real property exempt from 
taxation under the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe.2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 166 - LRB-2080/1

Automatically increasing the municipal services payments account
The bill increases the amounts transferred to the local government fund for 
payments for municipal services.  Under the bill, each fiscal year those amounts 
increase by the percentage change in the estimated amount of revenues received 
from the state sales and use tax for the previous fiscal year from the immediately 
preceding fiscal year.  Current law provides state aid payments to municipalities 
that provide municipal services to state facilities.
Energy and liquefied natural gas storage facilities
The bill provides utility aid payments to counties and municipalities where 
energy storage facilities are located.  Under the bill, DOA distributes to each city 
and village in which an energy storage facility is located two-thirds of the amount 
calculated by multiplying the facility [s megawatt capacity by $2,000, and the county 
in which such a facility is located is distributed one-third of the amount calculated 
by multiplying the facility [s megawatt capacity by $2,000.  DOA distributes to each 
town in which an energy storage facility is located one-third of the amount 
calculated by multiplying the facility [s megawatt capacity by $2,000, and the county 
in which such a facility is located is distributed two-thirds of the amount calculated 
by multiplying the facility [s megawatt capacity by $2,000.
The bill defines an Xenergy storage facility Y as property that receives electrical 
energy, stores the energy in a different form, and converts that other form of energy 
back to electrical energy for sale or to use to provide reliability or economic benefits 
to the electrical grid.  The bill also defines an Xenergy storage facility Y as property 
that is owned by a light, heat, and power company, electric cooperative, or municipal 
electric company and includes hydroelectric pumped storage, compressed air energy 
storage, regenerative fuel cells, batteries, and similar technologies.
The bill also provides utility aid payments to counties and municipalities 
where liquefied natural gas storage facilities (LNG storage facilities) are located.  
The payment received by a city or village where an LNG storage facility is located is 
determined by multiplying the net book value of the LNG storage facility by six 
mills and by three mills in the case of a town.  The payment received by a county 
where an LNG storage facility is located is determined by multiplying the net book 
value of the LNG storage facility by three mills if the facility is located in a city or 
village and by six mills if the facility is located in a town.
Aid to taxing jurisdictions for pipelines assessed by the state
Beginning in 2027, the bill requires the state to pay each taxing jurisdiction an 
amount equal to the property taxes levied on the pipeline property of a pipeline 
company for the property tax assessments as of January 1, 2024.  Generally under 
current law, the property of a pipeline company is subject to the public utilities tax, 
and property that is subject to the public utilities tax is exempt from local property 
taxation.
Aid to Green Bay for NFL draft public safety costs

Expenditure restraint incentive program
Under current law, generally, a municipality is eligible to receive an 
expenditure restraint incentive payment if its property tax levy is greater than five 
mills and if the annual increase in its municipal budget is less than the sum of 
factors based on inflation and the increased value of property in the municipality as 
a result of new construction.  Under the bill, the inflation factor used to determine 
eligibility is equal to the percentage change in the consumer price index or 3 
percent, whichever is greater.  The bill also excludes the following from being 
considered in determining eligibility for an expenditure restraint incentive program 
payment: 1) the amount by which a municipality [s base and supplemental county 
and municipal aid received in the applicable year exceeds the amount of base and 
supplemental county and municipal aid received by the municipality in 2024; 2) all 
grants received from the federal government; 3) revenues from a municipal vehicle 
registration fee that is approved by a majority of electors voting at a referendum; 4) 
the amount by which a municipality [s payments received for municipal services 
provided to facilities owned by the state exceeds the amount of those payments 
received in 2024; and 5) the $1,000,000 additional county and municipal aid 
payment to the city of Green Bay provided by the bill to reimburse public safety 
costs associated with the NFL draft in April 2025.
Local government fund transfer to offset certain sales tax exemptions
The bill increases the amount of the transfer from the general fund to the local 
government fund in fiscal year 2026-27 to compensate for the loss of sales and use 
tax revenues from the bill [s sales tax exemptions for over-the-counter prescription 
drugs and electricity and natural gas sold from May to October.  Under current law, 
the annual increase in the amount of the county and municipal aid payments and 
the supplemental county and municipal aid payments is determined by the 
percentage change in the revenues received from the sales and use tax.
Timing of transfers to the local government fund
The bill increases the annual July transfer from the general fund to the local 
government fund to cover the full amount of expenditure restraint incentive 
program payments, computer aid payments, and video service provider fee aid 
payments that are paid to taxing jurisdictions from the local government fund by 
the 4th Monday in July.
Moving the date of computer aid payments
Beginning in 2026, the bill requires DOA to make computer aid payments to 
taxing jurisdictions by the first Monday in May.  Under current law, computers and 
certain computer-related equipment are exempt from local personal property taxes, 
and DOA makes computer aid payments to taxing jurisdictions to compensate them 
for the corresponding loss of property tax revenue.  Current law requires DOA to 
make computer aid payments by the fourth Monday in July.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Grants for local projects
Current law requires the Building Commission to establish and operate a 
grant program to assist nonstate organizations to carry out construction projects 
having a statewide public purpose.  Before approving each grant, the Building 
Commission must determine that the organization carrying out the project has 
secured additional funding for the project from nonstate revenue sources in an 
amount that is equal to at least 50 percent of the total cost of the project.
The bill transfers the grant program to DOA.  However, the Building 
Commission retains its role in approving each grant, making the statewide public 
purpose determination, and making the determination concerning the amount of 
nonstate funds the prospective grantee has raised for a project.
The bill further authorizes additional grants under the program to cities, 
villages, towns, counties, and tribal governments for construction projects having a 
statewide public purpose if the grant is approved by the Building Commission.  
Under the bill, these grants are funded from the interest earnings of the local 
government segregated fund.
Finally, the bill specifically authorizes the following grants under the 
program, which are subject to Building Commission approval and the other 
requirements and limitations under the program:
1.  A grant of up to $4,000,000 to assist the New Community Shelter, Inc., in 
the construction of a permanent supportive housing facility in Brown County.
2.  A grant of up to $6,000,000 to assist the YMCA of Metropolitan Milwaukee, 
Inc., and Community Smiles Dental in carrying out renovation of the historic 
Wisconsin Avenue School in the city of Milwaukee for use as a health and wellness 
center.
3.  A grant of up to $15,000,000 to assist the Second Harvest Foodbank of 
Southern Wisconsin, Inc., in constructing a new facility to expand food processing, 
storage, and distribution.
4.  A grant of up to $860,000 to assist the Colfax Railroad Museum, Inc., in 
constructing and renovating museum facilities in the village of Colfax to protect 
and display historical railroad artifacts.
5.  A grant of up to $3,000,000 to assist the city of Green Bay in the 
construction and development of a public market.
6.  A grant of up to $4,250,000 to assist the city of Glendale in the construction 
of a new library that will serve the communities of Bayside, Fox Point, Glendale, 
and River Hills, as well as all of Milwaukee County through the Milwaukee County 
Federated Library System.
7.  A grant of up to $2,000,000 to a nonstate organization or a city, village, 
town, or county for the purchase, construction, or renovation of a child care center

Project labor agreements
Under current law, the state and local units of government are prohibited from 
engaging in certain practices in letting bids for state procurement or public works 
contracts. Among these prohibitions, the state and local governments may not do 
any of the following in specifications for bids for the contracts: 1) require that a 
bidder enter into an agreement with a labor organization; 2) consider, when 
awarding a contract, whether a bidder has or has not entered into an agreement 
with a labor organization; or 3) require that a bidder enter into an agreement that 
requires that the bidder or bidder [s employees become or remain members of a labor 
organization or pay any dues or fees to a labor organization.  The bill eliminates 
these limitations related to labor organizations.
Vacancies in certain appointive offices
Under current law, vacancies in public office may occur in a number of ways, 
including when the incumbent resigns, dies, or is removed from office, or, in the 
case of elected office, when the incumbent [s term expires.  However, as the 
Wisconsin Supreme Court held in State ex rel. Kaul v. Prehn , 2022 WI 50, expiration 
of an incumbent [s term of office does not create a vacancy if the office is filled by 
appointment for a fixed term.  Absent a vacancy or removal for cause, these 
incumbents may remain in office until their successors are appointed and qualified.
Under the bill, a vacancy in public office is created if the office is filled by 
appointment of the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate for a 
fixed term and the incumbent [s term expires or the governor submits his or her 
nomination for the office to the senate, whichever is later.
Office of Violence Prevention

Community climate engagement grant program
The bill requires DOA to establish and administer a community climate 
engagement grant program.  Under the program, DOA is required to award grants 
to local nongovernmental organizations in Wisconsin for the purpose of promoting 
local climate and clean energy community engagement.  Additionally, under the 
program, DOA is itself required to conduct and support outreach across Wisconsin 
concerning climate change, climate resilience, and the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions.
Community climate action grants
The bill requires DOA to create a grant program to assist local governmental 
units and governing bodies of federally recognized American Indian tribes and

plans or to implement emission reduction and action projects.  Under the bill, DOA 
is required to assist local governments and tribal governments with the 
development of climate risk assessment and action plans.
Grants to provide civil legal services
The bill requires DOA to award grants to the Wisconsin Trust Account 
Foundation, Inc., for the purpose of providing civil legal services.

related to translation services that are provided to a state agency through a state 
contract.  The bill also appropriates GPR for the purpose.
Artificial intelligence tools and infrastructure support
The bill requires DOA to develop and maintain artificial intelligence tools and 
infrastructure for the benefit of state agencies, including the legislature and the 
courts.
Cybersecurity
Under current law, DOA is required to ensure that an adequate level of 
information technology services is made available to state agencies.  The bill 
requires that DOA additionally conduct cybersecurity emergency incident response 
for state agencies.  The bill funds those activities with up to $10,000,000 each fiscal 
year in moneys from the general fund that are allocated to sum sufficient 
appropriations of state agencies.  A sum sufficient appropriation is expendable in 
the amounts necessary to accomplish the purpose specified in the appropriation.2025 - 2026  Legislature

The bill also creates an annual appropriation of GPR for DOA [s cybersecurity 
activities generally.
Cybersecurity insurance
The bill requires DOA to undertake planning and preparation to have a 
cybersecurity insurance program for executive branch agencies by the 2027 ]29 
fiscal biennium.
Closed meetings to consider information technology security issues
Under current law, a governmental body is generally required to meet in open 
session.  Open session is a meeting that is held in a place reasonably accessible to 
members of the public and open to all citizens at all times.
The bill allows a governmental body to go into closed session for the purpose of 
considering information technology security issues affecting information 
technology systems over which the governmental body has jurisdiction or exercises 
responsibility.
Funding for the Division of Alcohol Beverages
The bill creates a program-revenue appropriation to fund the Division of 
Alcohol Beverages (DAB) in DOR.
Under current law, the DAB administers and enforces the state [s alcohol 
beverage laws, including issuing alcohol beverage permits.  The DAB is currently 
funded from multiple DOR appropriations, including an appropriation that receives 
proceeds from an administrative fee of 11 cents per gallon on taxed distilled spirits.
The bill creates, for DAB, a single PR appropriation consisting of DAB permit 
fees and associated administrative fees and liquor tax administrative fees.
Public records location fee
Current law allows an authority to impose a fee on any person requesting a 
public record to cover the cost of locating that record, if the cost is $50 or more.  The 
location fee may not exceed the actual, necessary, and direct cost of locating the 
record.  Current law defines an Xauthority Y to include any elective official or state or 
local government agency that has custody of a public record.
Under the bill, the cost of locating a public record must be $100 or more before 
an authority may impose a fee to cover the actual, necessary, and direct cost of 
locating the record.
Lobbying fees
Under current law, fees paid to the Ethics Commission for lobbying activities 
are appropriated to the commission for the administration of the lobbying laws.  
The bill eliminates that appropriation and requires that all fees paid to the 
commission for lobbying activities be deposited in the general fund.
First class city school district audit response funding
The bill directs DOA to provide payments to a first class city school district 
(currently only Milwaukee Public Schools) to implement recommendations from 
audits of the school district initiated by the governor.  The payments may be used 
for items addressed in the audits, financial reporting software, and data 2025 - 2026  Legislature

compatibility with state and local finance systems.  Additionally, the payments may 
be made only if, at the time of payment, the secretary of administration is satisfied 
that the school district is already making substantial progress on implementation 
of the audit recommendations.
TEACH program; GPR funding
Under current law, DOA administers the Technology for Educational 
Achievement (TEACH) program.  The TEACH program offers telecommunications 
access to school districts, private schools, cooperative educational service agencies, 
technical college districts, independent charter school authorizers, juvenile 
correctional facilities, private and tribal colleges, and public library boards at 
discounted rates.  Currently, the TEACH program is funded from the universal 
service fund.  The bill provides additional GPR for the TEACH program.
TEACH; broadband speed threshold
As part of TEACH, current law requires DOA to establish an educational 
telecommunications access program to provide educational agencies with access to 
data lines.  Under current law, DOA must require an educational agency to pay not 
more than $250 per month for each data line provided under the program.  
However, the maximum amount DOA may charge an educational agency for a data 
line is not more than $100 per month if the data line relies on a transport medium 
that operates at a speed of 1.544 megabits per second.  The bill increases the 
threshold speed for the $100 per month maximum payment to 100 megabits per 
second.
State AmeriCorps scholarship program
Under current law, an individual who completes a term of service in the 
AmeriCorps program may receive a Segal AmeriCorps education award to pay for 
post-secondary educational expenses.  The bill creates a program that provides a 
matching scholarship to individuals who are residents of Wisconsin or who 
complete their AmeriCorps service in Wisconsin.  Under the bill, the matching 
amounts are subject to availability of monies.  The scholarship money awarded 
under the program may only be used to pay tuition and fees at a technical college, 
college, or university in Wisconsin.
National and community service board appropriation
Current law appropriates moneys received from the federal Corporation for 
National and Community Service (CNCS) to administer the national and 
community service program and to provide grants for the national and community 
service program.  The bill changes the appropriation for administration from one 
that is limited to the amounts in the schedule to one that appropriates all moneys 
received that are designated for administration by the CNCS.  The bill also clarifies 
that the appropriation for grants appropriates all moneys received that are 
designated for grants by the CNCS.
BCPL payments in lieu of taxes appropriation
Under current law, land that the BCPL owns is not subject to property taxes. 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 174 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
For certain lands purchased on or after July 14, 2015, though, BCPL makes annual 
payments to municipalities in lieu of the property tax that would have been owed on 
these lands were they not tax exempt. Currently, the source of these payments is a 
sum certain appropriation.  The bill changes that appropriation to a sum sufficient 
appropriation.
Security services at multitenant state buildings and facilities
The bill eliminates the separate appropriation for security services at 
multitenant state buildings and facilities and moves the related purposes of the 
appropriation to a different appropriation.
STATE  FINANCE
Refunding certain general obligation debt
The bill increases from $11,235,000,000 to $12,835,000,000 the amount of 
state public debt that may be contracted to refund any unpaid indebtedness used to 
finance tax-supported or self-amortizing facilities.  The unpaid indebtedness 
includes unpaid premium and interest amounts.  Under current law, the Building 
Commission may not incur public debt for refunding purposes unless the true 
interest costs to the state can be reduced.
STATE  EMPLOYMENT
Paid family and medical leave
The bill requires the administrator of the Division of Personnel Management 
in DOA to develop a program for paid family and medical leave of 8 weeks annually 
for most state employees.  The bill requires the administrator to submit the plan for 
approval as a change to the state compensation plan to the Joint Committee on 
Employment Relations (JCOER).  If JCOER approves the plan, the plan becomes 
effective January 1, 2027.
The bill also requires the Board of Regents of the UW System to develop a plan 
for a program for paid family and medical leave of 8 weeks annually for employees of 
the system and requires the board to submit the plan to the administrator of the 
Division of Personnel Management in DOA with its compensation plan changes for 
the 2025-27 biennium.  If JCOER approves the plan, the program becomes effective 
January 1, 2027.
Paid sick leave for limited term employees
Under current law, permanent and project state employees receive the 
following paid leave: vacation; personal holidays; sick leave; and legal holidays.  The 
bill requires the state to provide paid sick leave to limited term employees of the 
state at the same rate as to permanent and project state employees.
The bill also requires the Board of Regents of the UW System to develop a plan 
for a program for paid sick leave for temporary employees of the system and 
requires the board to submit the plan to the administrator of the Division of 
Personnel Management in DOA with its compensation plan changes for the 
2025]27 fiscal biennium.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Green Bay Correctional Institution
The bill allows the director of the Bureau of Merit Recruitment and Selection 
in the Division of Personnel Management in DOA to waive competitive hiring 
procedures for an employee in the classified service at the Green Bay Correctional 
Institution (GBCI) during the period the facility is decommissioned if the 
individual is qualified to perform the duties of the position and the position the 
individual will be filling is assigned to a class at a pay range that is the same as 
individual [s position at GBCI, or a lower pay range.
Vacation hours for state employees
The bill provides additional annual leave hours to state employees during 
their third, fourth, and fifth years of service.
Under current law, state employees who are in nonexempt status under the 
federal Fair Labor Standards Act earn annual leave at the rate of 104 hours per 
year of continuous service during the first five years of service and, on an 
employee [s fifth anniversary of continuous service, the rate increase to 144 hours of 
annual leave per year of continuous service. Under the bill, beginning on the 
employee [s second anniversary, a state employee in nonexempt status begins 
earning vacation hours at the rate of 120 hours per year of service.
Under current law, state employees who are in exempt status under the federal 
Fair Labor Standards Act earn annual vacation at the rate of 120 hours per year of 
continuous service during the first five years of service and, on the fifth 
anniversary of continuous service, the rate increase to 160 hours of annual leave 
per year of continuous service. Under the bill, beginning on the employee [s second 
anniversary, a state employee in exempt status begins earning vacation hours at the 
rate of 136 hours per year of service.
Removal of salary caps for WHEFA employees
Current law allows WHEFA to employ an executive director and limits the 
compensation of the executive director to the maximum of the salary range 
established for positions assigned to executive salary group 6.  Current law also 
limits the compensation of each other employee of WHEFA to the maximum of the 
salary range established for positions assigned to executive salary group 3.  The bill 
removes these limits on compensation of the executive director and employees of 
WHEFA.
Apprenticeship programs
Under current law, state agencies may provide on-the-job and off-the-job 
training to employees without loss of pay to employees.  This includes research 
projects, courses of study, institutes, short courses related to the performance of the 
employee [s job duties, and paying for tuition and related fees.  The bill allows a state 
agency to provide an apprenticeship program.  Under such a program, an 
apprentice is a probationary employee for the duration of the apprenticeship and 
attains permanent status upon completion of the apprenticeship but may be 
separated at any time during the apprenticeship without right of appeal.  Under the 
bill, the compensation plan for state employees may allow for rates of pay for 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 176 - LRB-2080/1

apprentices that reflect the appropriate beginning pay for apprentices as well as 
pay increases for the attainment of additional qualifications during the 
apprenticeship.  Finally, the bill provides that apprentices may take paid holidays 
in the same manner as other probationary employees.
Juneteenth state holiday
The bill designates June 19, the day on which Juneteenth is celebrated, as a 
state holiday on which state offices are closed.  Under current law, the offices of the 
agencies of state government are generally closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and a 
total of nine state holidays.  The bill also requires the administrator of the Division 
of Personnel Management in DOA to include June 19 and November 11, which is 
the day on which Veterans Day is traditionally celebrated, as paid holidays for UW 
System employees in the proposal it submits to the Joint Committee on Employee 
Relations for compensation plan changes for the 2025 ]27 fiscal biennium.
Veterans Day state holiday
The bill designates November 11, the day on which Veterans Day is 
traditionally celebrated, as a state holiday on which state offices are closed.  Under 
current law, the offices of the agencies of state government are generally closed on 
Saturdays, Sundays, and a total of nine state holidays.  Additionally, under current 
law, state employees receive annually a total of 4.5 paid personal holidays, one of 
which is provided specifically in recognition of Veterans Day.  Under the bill, state 
employees continue to receive 4.5 paid personal holidays.  However, the bill removes 
the specification that one of the paid personal holidays is provided in recognition of 
Veterans Day.
In total, the bill increases the number of regular paid holidays state employees 
receive annually from nine days to 11 days.
Supplemental appropriations for salary and fringe benefit costs incurred 
in enterprise assessments and billings
Under current law, if employees of an agency receive a salary increase under a 
compensation plan approved by JCOER or under a contract approved by the 
legislature, a state agency can request a program supplement to the agency [s 
budget from JCF in order to pay for the salary increase and related costs.
Some state agencies pay for services provided by DOA employees rather than 
having their own employees perform those services, and DOA assesses or bills the 
agencies for the services provided by DOA employees.  The bill creates four new 
appropriations from which an agency may request a program supplement when 
DOA assesses or bills the agency for increased costs for those services due to a 
salary increase under a compensation plan approved by JCOER or under a contract 
approved by the legislature.
Project employees of district attorney offices under ARPA
The bill provides that individuals who are in project positions that were 
funded by the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 in offices of district 
attorneys may be appointed to equivalent permanent positions in those offices

Position transfers and funding changes
Under the bill, all of the following occur: on January 1, 2027, the funding 
source for 24.0 FTE FED positions in DOA changes from a single DOA 
appropriation to two DOA program revenue appropriations and one DOA GPR 
appropriation; and 17.5 FTE FED positions and incumbent employees transfer 
from DOA to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, and the position 
funding changes to a single WERC GPR appropriation.
SECRETARY  OF STATE
Deputy secretary of state
The bill creates the position of deputy secretary of state.  The secretary of state 
may delegate any duty or power to the deputy secretary of state, except duties and 
powers the secretary of state performs as a member of the BCPL.
Appropriations to the secretary of state
Under current law, DFI [s general program operations are funded from an 
annual program revenue appropriation.  From this appropriation, $150,000 is 
transferred annually to an appropriation to the secretary of state for general 
program operations.  The bill increases the amount of the transfer to $502,900 in 
the 2025 ]26 fiscal year and $555,400 annually thereafter.
The bill also creates a continuing appropriation to the secretary of state of all 
moneys received from the federal government to be expended for the purposes for 
which received and creates a continuing program revenue appropriation to the 
secretary of state of all moneys received by the secretary of state from gifts, grants, 
bequests, and devises to be expended for the purposes for which made and received.  
The bill makes certain other changes to appropriations to the secretary of state, 
including an increase in the lapse of certain moneys appropriated to the secretary of 
state to the general fund at the end of each fiscal year.
Office of the Secretary of State
The bill provides that the Office of the Secretary of State is the exclusive office 
that may affix the great seal of the state of Wisconsin to a document and  
authenticate the document.  The bill also provides that the Office of the Secretary of 
State must provide apostille services.
LEGISLATURE
Popular initiative and referendum
The bill requires the legislature to introduce and vote on a joint resolution 
providing for a constitutional amendment that creates a petition process by which 
the people may propose and approve laws and constitutional amendments at an 
election and that creates a referendum process by which the people may reject an 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 178 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
act of the legislature.  A proposed constitutional amendment requires adoption by 
two successive legislatures, and ratification by the people, before it can become 
effective.
Specifically, the proposed constitutional amendment provides that the people 
may file a petition with the agency that administers state elections (currently the 
Elections Commission) for a referendum to reject any act of the legislature, a section 
of any act, or an item of appropriation in any act.
A petition for referendum must be signed by qualified electors equaling at 
least 4 percent of the vote cast for the office of governor at the last preceding 
gubernatorial election.  A qualified elector is a U.S. citizen age 18 or older who has 
resided in an election district or ward in Wisconsin for at least 28 days.
After validating a petition [s signatures, the agency that administers state 
elections is required to order a referendum at the next general election occurring at 
least 120 days after the petition was filed with the agency.  No act or part of an act 
rejected in a referendum may be reenacted during the legislative session in which it 
was rejected.
The proposed constitutional amendment further provides that the people may 
propose, by petition filed with the agency that administers state elections, laws and 
constitutional amendments for a vote at an election.  The petition must satisfy all of 
the following conditions:
1.  For a petition for an initiative law, be signed by qualified electors equaling 
at least 6 percent of the vote cast for the office of governor at the last preceding 
gubernatorial election.
2.  For a petition for an initiative constitutional amendment, be signed by 
qualified electors equaling at least 8 percent of the vote cast for the office of 
governor at the last preceding gubernatorial election.
3.  Include the full text of the proposed law or constitutional amendment 
prepared in proper form.  Upon request by any qualified elector, the agency that 
administers state elections is required to have the proposed law or constitutional 
amendment drafted in proper form and made available to the public.  The proposed 
law or amendment must embrace no more than one subject, and that subject must 
be expressed in the title.
4.  Be filed with the agency that administers state elections not less than 120 
days before the election at which the proposed law or constitutional amendment is 
to be voted upon.
Similar to the process for a referendum, after verifying an initiative petition [s 
signatures, the agency that administers state elections is required to order the 
submission of the initiative law or constitutional amendment to the qualified 
electors of the state for their approval or rejection at the next succeeding general 
election occurring at least 120 days after the petition was filed with the agency.
If approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting at the election, an 
initiative law or constitutional amendment goes into effect on the 30th day after the 
date the agency that administers state elections certifies the election results, unless 2025 - 2026  Legislature

a different effective date is specified in the initiative.  The legislature may not 
repeal or amend an initiative law for the two years immediately succeeding its 
publication and may not repeal or amend an initiative law except by a vote of two-
thirds of all members elected to each house.  If an initiative law or constitutional 
amendment is rejected at the election, substantially the same initiative law or 
amendment, as determined by the agency that administers state elections, may not 
be considered again by voters under the initiative process for at least five years.
Legislative intervention in certain court proceedings
Current law provides that the legislature may intervene as a matter of right in 
an action in state or federal court when a party to the action does any of the 
following:
1.  Challenges the constitutionality of a statute.
2.  Challenges a statute as violating or being preempted by federal law.
3.  Otherwise challenges the construction or validity of a statute.
Current law further provides that the legislature must be served with a copy 
of the proceedings in all such actions, regardless of whether the legislature 
intervenes in the action.
The bill eliminates all of these provisions.
Retention of legal counsel by the legislature
Current law allows representatives to the assembly and senators, as well as 
legislative employees, to receive legal representation from DOJ in most legal 
proceedings.  However, current law also provides all of the following:
1.  With respect to the assembly, that the speaker of the assembly may 
authorize a representative to the assembly or assembly employee who requires legal 
representation to obtain outside legal counsel if the acts or allegations underlying 
the action are arguably within the scope of the representative [s or employee [s 
legislative duties, and the speaker may obtain outside legal counsel in any action in 
which the assembly is a party or in which the interests of the assembly are affected, 
as determined by the speaker.
2.  With respect to the senate, that the senate majority leader may authorize a 
senator or senate employee who requires legal representation to obtain outside legal 
counsel if the acts or allegations underlying the action are arguably within the 
scope of the senator [s or employee [s legislative duties, and the majority leader may 
obtain outside legal counsel in any action in which the senate is a party or in which 
the interests of the senate are affected, as determined by the majority leader.
3.  That the cochairpersons of the Joint Committee on Legislative 
Organization (JCLO) may authorize a legislative service agency employee who 
requires legal representation to obtain outside legal counsel if the acts or 
allegations underlying the action are arguably within the scope of the employee [s 
legislative duties, and the cochairpersons may obtain outside legal counsel in any 
action in which the legislature is a party or in which the interests of the legislature 
are affected, as determined by the cochairpersons.2025 - 2026  Legislature

The bill eliminates these provisions.  Under the bill, representatives to the 
assembly and senators, as well as legislative employees, may continue to receive 
legal representation from DOJ in most legal proceedings.
Advice and consent of the senate
Under current law, any individual nominated by the governor or another state 
officer or agency subject to the advice and consent of the senate, whose 
confirmation for the office or position is rejected by the senate, may not do any of the 
following during the legislative session biennium in which his or her nomination is 
rejected:
1.  Hold the office or position for which he or she was rejected.
2.  Be nominated again for that office or position.
3.  Perform any duties of that office or position.
The bill eliminates those restrictions.
Records and correspondence of legislators
Under current law, the Public Records Board prescribes policies and 
standards for the retention and disposition of public records made or received by a 
state officer or agency.  However, for purposes of public records retention, the 
definition of Xpublic records Y does not include the records and correspondence of 
any legislator.  The bill eliminates that exception for a legislator [s records and 
correspondence.
Passive review by JCF; objections to be public
Current law requires that JCF review certain proposed actions before an 
agency may execute the action.  The review required often takes the form of a 
passive review.  In a passive review, the agency must submit the proposed action to 
JCF and if the cochairpersons of JCF do not notify the agency within a certain 
period, often 14 days, that a member of JCF has objected to the action, the agency 
may execute the proposed action.  If, however, a member objects, the agency is 
limited to the action as approved or modified by JCF.  The bill specifies that the 
name of any JCF member who objects to the proposed action, as well as the reason 
the member objects, must be recorded and made publicly available.
Capitol security
Under current law, DOA is required to submit any proposed changes to 
security at the capitol, including the posting of a firearm restriction, to JCLO for 
approval under passive review.  The bill eliminates that requirement.
TAXATION
INCOME  TAXATION
Tax exemption for tips

Earned income tax credit
The bill increases the amount that an individual with fewer than three 
qualifying children may claim as the Wisconsin earned income tax credit (EITC).  
Under current law, the Wisconsin EITC is equal to a percentage of the federal 
EITC.  The percentage is 4 percent of the federal EITC if the individual has one 
qualifying child, 11 percent if the individual has two qualifying children, and 34 
percent if the individual has three or more qualifying children.  The credit is 
refundable, which means that if the credit exceeds the individual [s tax liability, he 
or she will receive the excess as a refund check.
Under the bill, the percentage of the federal EITC that an eligible individual 
may claim for Wisconsin purposes is 16 percent if the individual has one qualifying 
child, 25 percent if the individual has two qualifying children, and 34 percent if the 
individual has three or more qualifying children.
Homestead tax credit expansion
Under current law, the homestead tax credit is a refundable income tax credit 
that may be claimed by homeowners and renters.  The credit is based on the 
claimant [s household income and the amount of property taxes or rent constituting 
property taxes on his or her Wisconsin homestead.  Because the credit is 
refundable, if the credit exceeds the claimant [s income tax liability, he or she 
receives the excess as a refund check.  Under current law, there are three key dollar 
amounts used when calculating the credit:
1.  If household income is $8,060 or less, the credit is 80 percent of the property 
taxes or rent constituting property taxes.  If household income exceeds $8,060, the 
property taxes or rent constituting property taxes are reduced by 8.785 percent of 
the household income exceeding $8,060, and the credit is 80 percent of the reduced 
property taxes or rent constituting property taxes.
2.  The credit may not be claimed if household income exceeds $24,680.
3.  The maximum property taxes or rent constituting property taxes used to 
calculate the credit is $1,460.
Beginning with claims filed for the 2025 tax year, the bill increases the income 
phase-out threshold from $8,060 to $19,000, reduces the percentage used for 
household income above the income phase-out threshold to 7.891 percent, and 
increases the maximum income amount from $24,680 to $37,500.  The bill also 
indexes the $19,000, $37,500, and $1,460 amounts for inflation during future tax 
years.
Changing the name of the homestead credit
The bill also renames the homestead income tax credit to the property tax and 
rent rebate.
Veterans and surviving spouses property tax credit eligibility expansion
The bill reduces the eligibility threshold for an eligible veteran, the spouse of 
an eligible veteran, and the unremarried surviving spouse of an eligible veteran to 
claim the veterans and surviving spouses property tax credit under the individual 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 182 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
income tax system.  Under the bill, a claimant may claim the credit if the service-
connected disability rating of the veteran for whom the claimant is claiming the 
credit is at least 70 percent.  Currently, that rating must be 100 percent.
Under the bill, the maximum credit that a claimant may claim is multiplied by 
the percentage of the service-connected disability rating.  The bill does not affect a 
claimant who claims the credit based on the individual unemployability rating.  
Under current law, a claimant may also claim the credit if the disability rating 
based on individual unemployability of the veteran for whom the claimant is 
claiming the credit is 100 percent.
Rent qualifying for the veterans and surviving spouses property tax credit
Current law does not expressly address the treatment of renters for purposes 
of claiming the veterans and surviving spouses property tax credit.  DOR allows an 
eligible veteran or surviving spouse who is a renter to claim the credit if he or she is 
required to pay the property taxes under a written agreement with the landlord 
and pays the property taxes directly to the municipality.
Under the bill, an eligible veteran or surviving spouse who is a renter may 
claim the veterans and surviving spouses property tax credit in an amount equal to 
his or her rent constituting property taxes.  The bill defines Xrent constituting 
property taxes Y to mean 20 percent of the rent paid during the year for the use of a 
principal dwelling if heat is included in the rent and 25 percent of the rent if heat is 
not included.
Adding a fifth income tax bracket
The bill adds a fifth income tax bracket having a rate of 9.80 percent for 
individuals and married joint filers with taxable income exceeding $1,000,000 and 
for married separate filers with taxable income exceeding $500,000.  Under current 
law, there are four income tax brackets for single individuals, certain fiduciaries, 
heads of households, and married persons.  The brackets are indexed for inflation.
Under the bill, which first applies to taxable year 2025, there are five income 
tax brackets for single individuals, certain fiduciaries, heads of households, and 
married persons.  The brackets are indexed for inflation.  The rate of taxation under 
the bill for the five brackets for single individuals, certain fiduciaries, and heads of 
households, before indexing, is as follows:
1.  For taxable income not exceeding $7,500, 3.5 percent.
2.  For taxable income exceeding $7,500, but not $15,000, 4.40 percent.
3. For taxable income exceeding $15,000, but not $225,000, 5.3 percent.
4. For taxable income exceeding $225,000, but not $1,000,000, 7.65 percent.
5. For taxable income exceeding $1,000,000, 9.80 percent.
The rates that apply to married joint filers under the bill are the same as the 
rates that apply to single individuals, fiduciaries, and heads of households, but the 
income limitations are higher.  The lowest bracket applies to taxable income not 
exceeding $10,000; the second bracket applies to taxable income exceeding $10,000, 
but not $20,000; the third bracket applies to taxable income exceeding $20,000, but 2025 - 2026  Legislature

not $1,000,000; and the fifth bracket applies to taxable income exceeding 
$1,000,000.
Increasing the personal exemption
The bill increases from $700 to $1,200 the income tax personal exemption for 
taxpayers, their spouses, and their dependents.
Manufacturing and agriculture credit limitation
Currently, a person may claim a tax credit on the basis of the person [s income 
from manufacturing or agriculture.  A taxpayer may claim a credit equal to 7.5 
percent of the income derived either from the sale of tangible personal property 
manufactured in whole or in part on property in this state that is assessed as 
manufacturing property or from the sale of tangible personal property produced, 
grown, or extracted in whole or in part from property in this state assessed as 
agricultural property.  If the amount of the credit exceeds the taxpayer [s income tax 
liability, the taxpayer does not receive a refund, but may apply the balance to the 
taxpayer [s tax liability in subsequent taxable years.
The bill limits to $300,000 the amount of income from manufacturing that a 
person may use as the basis for claiming the credit.  The bill does not affect the 
amount of income from agriculture that may be used as a basis for claiming the 
credit.
Film production tax credit
The bill creates income and franchise tax credits for film production 
companies, and the Department of Tourism implements the tax credit.  Under the 
bill, a film production company may claim a credit that is equal to 25 percent of the 
salary or wages paid to the company [s employees in the taxable year for services 
rendered in this state to produce a film, video, broadcast advertisement, or 
television production, as approved by the Department of Tourism, and paid to 
employees who were residents of this state at the time that they were paid.  The 
total amount of the credits that may be claimed by a taxpayer may not exceed an 
amount that is equal to the first $250,000 of salary and wages paid to each of the 
taxpayer [s employees in the taxable year, not including the salary or wages paid to 
the taxpayer [s two highest-paid employees in the taxable year, for a production with 
budgeted expenditures of $1,000,000 or more.  If the total amount of the credits 
claimed by a taxpayer exceeds the taxpayer [s tax liability, the state will not issue a 
refund, but the taxpayer may carry forward any remaining credit to subsequent 
taxable years.
Under the bill, a film production company may claim an income and franchise 
tax credit in an amount that is equal to 25 percent of the production expenditures 
paid by the company in the taxable year to produce a film, video, broadcast 
advertisement, or television production.  If the total amount of the credits claimed 
by the company exceeds the company [s tax liability, the state will issue a refund.
The bill also allows a film production company to claim an income and 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 184 - LRB-2080/1

franchise tax credit, for the first three taxable years that the company is doing 
business in this state, in an amount that is equal to 25 percent of the amount that 
the claimant paid in the taxable year to purchase depreciable tangible personal 
property or to acquire, construct, rehabilitate, remodel, or repair real property.
Under the bill, a film production company may claim an income and franchise 
tax credit that is equal to the amount of sales and use taxes that the claimant paid 
for tangible personal property and taxable services that are used to produce a film, 
video, broadcast advertisement, or television production in this state.
The bill provides that the Department of Tourism may not allocate more than 
$10,000,000 in film production and investments tax credits in each fiscal year.  The 
bill also requires the Department of Tourism to annually submit a report to the 
legislature that specifies the number of persons who submitted credit applications 
in the previous year and the amount of the credits allocated to each such applicant 
and to make recommendations on improving the efficiency of the program.  Finally, 
the bill requires the Legislative Audit Bureau to biennially prepare a performance 
evaluation audit of the program implemented by the Department of Tourism.
Eligibility of nuclear power research for the research credit
Under the bill, beginning in the 2025 tax year, qualified research expenses 
incurred for research related to nuclear power are eligible for the research income 
tax credit.  Under current law, the research credit is an income and franchise tax 
credit equal to a specified percentage of the person [s qualified research expenses 
that exceed 50 percent of the average qualified research expenses for the three 
taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year for which the person claims 
the credit.  Current law allows a person to receive a refund in an amount not 
exceeding 25 percent of their allowable claim for the research credit.
Changes to state supplement to federal historic rehabilitation credit
The bill makes the following changes to the state supplement to the federal 
historic rehabilitation credit:  1) eliminates the requirement for claiming the credit 
of incurring at least $50,000 in qualified rehabilitation expenditures; 2) eliminates 
the requirement that the state credit be claimed at the same time as the claimant 
claims the federal historic rehabilitation credit; and 3) allows partnerships, limited 
liability companies, and tax-option corporations to claim the credit and prohibits 
partners of a partnership, members of a limited liability company, and shareholders 
of a tax-option corporation from claiming the credit.  Current law authorizes WEDC 
to certify a person to receive a tax credit equal to 20 percent of the qualified 
rehabilitation expenses, as defined under federal law, for certified historic 
structures on property located in this state and for the rehabilitation expenses for 
qualified rehabilitated buildings, as defined under federal law, that are not certified 
historic structures.
Flood insurance premiums
The bill creates a nonrefundable individual income tax credit for flood 
insurance premiums.  The credit is equal to 10 percent of the amount of the 
premiums that an individual paid in the taxable year for flood insurance, but the 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 185 - LRB-2080/1

amount of the claim may not exceed $60 in any taxable year.  Because the credit is 
nonrefundable, it may be claimed only up to the amount of the individual [s tax 
liability.
Private school tuition deduction
Under current law, an individual, when computing income for income tax 
purposes, may deduct the tuition paid during the year to send his or her dependent 
child to private school.  The maximum deduction is $4,000 for an elementary school 
pupil and $10,000 for a secondary school pupil.
Under the bill, only individuals whose Wisconsin adjusted gross income is 
below a threshold amount may claim the deduction for private school tuition.  The 
threshold amount is $100,000 for single individuals and heads of household, 
$150,000 for married couples filing jointly, and $75,000 for married individuals 
filing separately.
Increasing disability income subtraction and expanding eligibility
The bill increases and expands the individual state income tax subtraction, or 
deduction, for disability payments received by a person under the age of 65 who is 
retired and who is permanently and totally disabled.  Under the bill, beginning in 
tax year 2025, up to $5,500 of disability payments may be subtracted annually from 
an individual [s taxable income.  In addition, the bill expands eligibility for claiming 
the subtraction to individuals having a federal adjusted gross income under 
$30,000 or under $60,000 if married.
Under current law, up to $5,000 of disability payments may be subtracted, and 
to be eligible, a person must have federal adjusted gross income under $20,200 or 
under $25,400 if married and both spouses are disabled.

the amount of membership dues and expenses paid by a person to a labor 
organization.
Increasing the adoption deduction
The bill increases to $15,000 the maximum deduction allowed for adoption 
expenses for purposes of the state income tax.  Under current law, a full-year 
resident who is an adoptive parent may deduct from taxable income up to $5,000 of 
the adoption fees, court costs, or legal fees relating to the adoption of a child paid 
during the tax year during which the final order of adoption has been entered and 
paid during the prior two tax years.
Tax credit for installing universal changing stations
The bill creates an income and franchise tax credit for small businesses that 
install universal changing stations.  Under the bill, a Xuniversal changing station Y 
is a floor-mounted or wall-mounted, powered, and height-adjustable adult changing 
table with a safety rail that can be used for personal hygiene by an individual with 
a disability of either sex and the individual [s care provider.
The credit applies for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.  2025 - 2026  Legislature

ALL:all
Under the bill, a small business is any entity that, during the preceding taxable 
year, either had gross receipts of no more than $1,000,000 or employed no more 
than 30 full-time employees.  The credit is equal to 50 percent of the amount the 
small business paid to install the universal changing station, up to a maximum 
credit of $5,125.  The credit may be claimed only if the universal changing station 
meets certain requirements relating to size, maneuverability space, weight load, 
and adjustability.
Dividends received deduction limitation
Current law allows corporations to deduct, for income and franchise tax 
purposes, the dividends received from related corporations.  The dividends must be 
paid on common stock, and the corporation receiving the dividends must own at 
least 70 percent of the total combined voting stock of the other corporation.  Current 
law also allows businesses to carry forward net business losses to future taxable 
years in order to offset income in those years.  Under the bill, a business may not 
take the dividends received deduction into account when determining if it has a net 
business loss that can be carried forward.
Internal Revenue Code references
The bill adopts, for state income and franchise tax purposes, certain changes 
made to the Internal Revenue Code by the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted 
in December 2017.  The bill adopts provisions of the act related to the limitation on 
losses for taxpayers other than corporations; certain special rules for the taxable

limitation on the deduction by employers of expenses for fringe benefits; the 
limitation on the deduction for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums; 
and the limitation on excessive employee remuneration.

Manufacturing property assessment fees
Under current law, DOR assesses manufacturing property for property tax 
purposes and imposes a fee on each municipality in which the property is located to 
cover part of the assessment costs.  If a municipality does not pay by March 31 of the 
following year, DOR reduces the municipality [s July and November shared revenue 
distribution by the amount of the fee.  The bill requires the fee to be collected from 
a reduction in the municipality [s shared revenue distribution, and if DOR is unable 
to collect the fee in this manner, then the fee is directly imposed on the 
municipality.
GENERAL  TAXATION
Sales tax exemption for electricity and natural gas
Under current law, electricity and natural gas sold during the months of 
November, December, January, February, March, and April for residential use is

electricity and natural gas sold for residential use regardless of when it is sold.
Sales tax exemption for over-the-counter drugs

drugs.
County and municipality sales and use taxes
Current law allows a county to enact an ordinance to impose sales and use 
taxes at the rate of 0.5 percent of the sales price or purchase price on tangible 
personal property and taxable services.  The county must use the revenue from the 
taxes for property tax relief.  Under the bill, a county may impose that county sales 
and use tax at the rate of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 percent.  The bill also allows a 
county, except for Milwaukee County, to impose, by ordinance, an additional sales 
and use tax at the rate of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 percent of the sales price or 
purchase price on tangible personal property and taxable services.  However, the 
ordinance does not take effect unless approved by a majority of the voters of the 
county at a referendum.  The revenue from those taxes may be used for any purpose 
designated by the county board or specified in the ordinance or in the referendum 
approving the ordinance.
The bill also allows a municipality, except for the City of Milwaukee, with a 
2020 population exceeding 30,000 to enact an ordinance to impose sales and use 
taxes at the rate of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 percent of the sales price or purchase 
price on tangible personal property and taxable services.  The ordinance does not

planning and counseling services for the restoration, reclamation, or revitalization 
of prairie, savanna, or wetlands if such services are provided for a separate and 
optional fee distinct from other services.
Sales tax exemption for energy systems
Current law provides a sales and use tax exemption for a product that has as 
its power source wind energy, direct radiant energy received from the sun, or gas 
generated from anaerobic digestion of animal manure and other agricultural waste, 
if the product produces at least 200 watts of alternating current or 600 British 
thermal units per day.  The sale of electricity or energy produced by the product is 
also exempt.
The bill modifies current law so that the exemption applies to solar power 
systems and wind energy systems that produce electrical or heat energy directly 
from the sun or wind and are capable of continuously producing at least 200 watts 
of alternating current or 600 British thermal units.  In addition, the exemption 
applies to a waste energy system that produces electrical or heat energy directly 
from gas generated from anaerobic digestion of animal manure and other 
agricultural waste and is capable of continuously producing at least 200 watts of

is imposed at the rate of 5 cents per milliliter of the liquid or other substance based 
on the volume as listed by the manufacturer.
The bill taxes vapor products at the rate of 71 percent of the manufacturer [s 
established list price and modifies the definition of Xvapor product. Y  Under the bill, 
Xvapor product Y means a noncombustible product that employs a heating element, 
power source, electronic circuit, or other electronic, chemical, or mechanical means 
that can be used to produce vapor from a solution or other substance, regardless of 
whether the product contains nicotine.  A Xvapor product Y is defined to include an 
electronic cigarette, electronic cigar, electronic cigarillo, electronic pipe, or similar 
product or device, as well as any container of a solution or other substance that is 
intended to be used with these items.  The bill specifies that any product regulated 
by the federal Food and Drug Administration as a drug or device is not a vapor 
product.

amount in controversy is less than or equal to the amount used to determine the 
applicability of small claims procedure to certain civil actions under current law, 
which is currently $10,000.  Under current law, the definition of Xsmall claims Y for 
cases decided by the Tax Appeals Commission is $2,500, and certain procedures of 
the Tax Appeals Commission for deciding cases differ between small claims cases 
and non]small claims cases.
Electronic filing of petitions with Tax Appeals Commission
The bill allows electronic filing of petitions for review to the Tax Appeals 
Commission and specifies that a petition filed electronically is considered timely 
filed if submitted by midnight of the last day for filing.
Providing notices for public utility taxes
Under current law, public utility companies, including railroads and air 
carriers, are exempt from local property taxes and instead are subject to special 
state taxes.  Current law requires DOR to send certain notices regarding these 
taxes by certified mail.  Under the bill, DOR must still provide the notices but is no 2025 - 2026  Legislature

TRANSPORTATION
HIGHWAYS  AND LOCAL  ASSISTANCE
Enumeration of the I 39/90/94 project
Under current law, major highway projects must be specifically authorized by 
the legislature and approved by the transportation projects commission before 
construction on the project may begin.  The bill enumerates the I 39/90/94 project, 
which the bill defines to mean XI 39/90/94 extending approximately 67 miles in 
Dane, Columbia, Sauk, and Juneau counties from USH 12/18 in Madison to USH 
12/STH 16 in Wisconsin Dells, including I 39 from I 90/94 to Levee Road near the 
city of Portage, and including all interchanges and work on adjacent roadways 
necessary for the completion of the project. Y
Currently, moneys are appropriated to DOT for various purposes relating to 
state highway facilities.  DOT is prohibited from encumbering or expending those 
moneys for purposes related to the purchase of land, easements, or development 
rights in land, unless the purchase is in association with a highway project and the 
land or interest in land is located within one-quarter mile of the highway.  The bill 
exempts the I 39/90/94 project from this prohibition.
Sound barriers on I 894
The bill requires DOT, during the 2025 ]27 fiscal biennium, to allocate 
$19,500,000 for the construction of sound barriers on I 894, between 27th street and 
76th street, in Milwaukee County.
Contract cost threshold for gubernatorial approval
Under current law, DOT may enter into contracts for services. Certain 
contracts that exceed a specified cost threshold require the approval of the governor.  
The bill increases the cost threshold for the following contract types:
1. For engineering, consulting, surveying, or other specialized services, 
increased from $3,000 to $100,000.
2. For highway improvements, increased from $1,000 to $250,000.
3. For counties to perform highway improvements, increased from $5,000 to 
$100,000.
4. For performing portions of improvement work affecting railroads or 
utilities, increased from $5,000 to $100,000.
5. For prompt repair, protection, or preservation of state highways jeopardized 
by extraordinary conditions or emergency, increased from $10,000 to $100,000.
Requirements for local transportation projects
Under current law, for certain highway projects for which DOT spends federal 
money, federal money must make up at least 70 percent of the funding for those 
projects.  DOT is required to notify political subdivisions receiving aid for local 
projects whether the aid includes federal moneys and how those moneys must be 
spent.  For certain projects that receive no federal money, DOT may not require 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 191 - LRB-2080/1

political subdivisions to comply with any portion of DOT [s facilities development 
manual other than design standards.  Any local project funded with state funds 
under the surface transportation program or the local bridge program must be let 
through competitive bidding and by contract to the lowest responsible bidder.  The 
bill eliminates all of these requirements.
Traffic calming grants
Under the bill, DOT must develop and administer a local traffic calming grant 
program.  Under the program, DOT must award grants to political subdivisions for 
infrastructure projects designed to reduce the speed of vehicular traffic.
Mass transit aids
Under current law, DOT provides state aid payments to local public bodies in 
urban areas served by mass transit systems to assist the local public bodies with 
the expenses of operating those systems.  There are five classes of mass transit 
systems, and the total amount of state aid payments to four of these classes is 
limited to a specific amount in each calendar year.  The fifth class consists of certain 
commuter or light rail systems, and no state aid amounts are specified for this class. 
The bill modifies the criteria by which mass transit systems are placed into 
classes, modifying the threshold operating expenses for each class and updating the 
census by which population-based class distinctions are determined for two of the 
classes.
For the four classes of mass transit systems for which state aid amounts are 
specified, the bill does the following to the total amount limits:
1.  For mass transit systems having annual operating expenses of 
$100,000,000 or more, the bill maintains the current limit of $66,787,400 in 
calendar year 2025 and increases the limit to $69,458,900 in calendar year 2026 
and to $72,237,300 in calendar year 2027 and thereafter.
2.  For mass transit systems having annual operating expenses of more than 
$30,000,000 but less than $100,000,000, the bill maintains the current limit of 
$17,549,500 in calendar year 2025 and increases the limit to $18,251,500 in 
calendar year 2026 and to $18,981,600 in calendar year 2027 and thereafter.
3.  For mass transit systems serving urban areas having a population of at 
least 50,000 but having annual operating expenses of no more than $30,000,000, 
the bill maintains the current limit of $25,475,900 in calendar year 2025 and 
increases the limit to $26,494,900 in calendar year 2026 and to $27,554,700 in 
calendar year 2027 and thereafter.
4.  For mass transit systems serving urban areas having a population of less 
than 50,000, the bill maintains the current limit of $5,398,600 in calendar year 
2025 and increases the limit to $9,800,600 in calendar year 2026 and to 
$10,192,600 in calendar year 2027 and thereafter.
General transportation aids
Under current law, DOT administers a general transportation aids program 
that makes aid payments to a county based on a share-of-costs formula, and to a 
municipality based on the greater of a share-of-costs formula or an aid rate per 2025 - 2026  Legislature

mile. The aid rate per mile is $2,734 for 2025.  The bill increases the aid rate per 
mile to $2,816 for 2026 and $2,901 for 2027 and thereafter.
Currently, the maximum annual amount of aid that may be paid to counties 
under the program is $132,276,700.  The bill maintains this amount for 2025 and 
increases this amount to $136,245,000 for 2026 and $140,332,400 for 2027 and 
thereafter.  Currently, the maximum annual amount of aid that may be paid to 
municipalities under the program is $415,116,200. The bill maintains this amount 
for 2025 and increases this amount to $427,569,700 for 2026 and $440,396,800 for 
2027 and thereafter.
Local road improvement program funding
Under current law, DOT administers the local roads improvement program 
(LRIP) to assist political subdivisions in improving seriously deteriorating local 
roads by reimbursing political subdivisions for certain improvements. LRIP has 
several components, including discretionary grants.  Current law specifies dollar 
amounts that DOT must allocate in each fiscal year to each of three project types 
that exceed specified cost thresholds:  1) county trunk highway improvements that 
exceed $250,000; 2) town road improvements that exceed $100,000; and 3) 
municipal street improvements that exceed $250,000.
The bill increases the amounts that DOT is required to allocate for 
discretionary grants for the three project types, as follows:
1.  Allocations for county trunk highway improvements are increased from 
$5,840,200 to $6,015,400 in fiscal year 2025 ]26 and $6,195,900 in fiscal year 
2026]27 and each fiscal year thereafter.
2.  Allocations for town road improvements are increased from $6,398,000 to 
$6,590,000 in fiscal year 2025 ]26 and $6,787,600 in fiscal year 2026 ]27 and each 
fiscal year thereafter.
3.  Allocations for municipal street improvements are increased from 
$4,166,900 to $4,291,900 in fiscal year 2025 ]26 and $4,420,700 in fiscal year 
2026]27 and each fiscal year thereafter.
In addition to the ongoing LRIP, onetime funding has previously been 
appropriated to provide supplemental grants to local governments for projects that 
are eligible for discretionary grants.  This funding was provided for fiscal year 
2019]20, with specified amounts required to be allocated between improvement 
projects on county trunk highways, town roads, and municipal streets. The bill 
provides that supplemental grants in fiscal year 2025 ]26 be allocated so that the 
total funding is distributed among the three project types at the same percentage 
that each group was allocated funding in fiscal year 2019 ]20.  The bill changes the 
funding source for these grants from the transportation fund to the general fund.
Local roads improvement grants to Ontario and DeForest
The bill requires DOT to provide local roads improvement program (LRIP) 
grants of $500,000 to the village of Ontario for residential street development and 
$6,000,000 to the village of DeForest for improvements to the I 39/CTH XVY 
interchange.  Under current law, DOT administers LRIP to assist political 
subdivisions in improving seriously deteriorating local roads by reimbursing 
political subdivisions for certain improvements.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Agricultural roads improvement program general fund appropriation
Under current law, DOT administers an agricultural roads improvement 
program (ARIP) under which DOT provides grants to political subdivisions for 
projects to improve certain highway facilities that facilitate access to agricultural 
lands.  Currently, a transportation fund appropriation funds the grants.  The bill 
adds a general fund appropriation to fund grants under the program.
Agricultural roads improvement program time limits
Currently, all grants under ARIP must be awarded by June 23, 2026, and only 
costs incurred by June 23, 2028, may be reimbursed.  These dates represent three 
years and five years, respectively, from the effective date of the bill creating ARIP.
The bill provides that any grants made from moneys appropriated in the 
2025]27 fiscal biennium must be awarded by three years from the effective date of 
the bill and only costs incurred by five years from the effective date of the bill may 
be reimbursed.
Local bridge and culvert improvements set-aside
The bill requires DOT to designate 10 percent of the moneys appropriated for 
LRIP discretionary supplemental grants and ARIP in the 2025 ]27 fiscal biennium 
for grants for improvements to certain local bridges or culverts identified as being 
in poor or worse condition.
County forest road aids
Under current law, DOT provides aid to counties for the improvement of public 
roads within county forests.  The current amount of aid is $351 per mile of county 
forest road.  The bill maintains the aid amount for calendar year 2025 and increases 
the aid amount, per mile of road, to $361 in calendar year 2026 and $373 in 
calendar year 2027 and each year thereafter.
Bonding authority for design-build program
Under current law, DOT administers the design-build project program, under 
which highway improvement project contracts are awarded to a single builder that 
designs, engineers, and constructs the project.  Under the program, DOT may fund 
state highway rehabilitation projects, major highway projects, or southeast 
Wisconsin freeway megaprojects.  The state is authorized to contract public debt in 
an amount up to $20,000,000 for the program.  The bill increases the authorized 
public debt for this purpose by $92,500,000, to $112,500,000.
I 94 east-west corridor bonding
Under current law, the state may contract up to $40,000,000 in public debt for 
reconstruction of the XI 94 east-west corridor, Y which is all freeways, including 
related interchange ramps, roadways, and shoulders, encompassing I 94 in 
Milwaukee County from 70th Street to 16th Street, and all adjacent frontage roads 
and collector road systems.  The bill increases the authorized general obligation 
bonding limit for this purpose by $185,171,300, to a total of $225,171,300.
Use of revenue bond proceeds for state highway rehabilitation
Under current law, the Building Commission may issue revenue bonds for 
certain major highway projects and transportation administrative facilities.  Also 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 194 - LRB-2080/1

major highway projects and transportation administrative facilities in a principal 
amount that may not exceed $4,325,885,700.  The bill increases the revenue bond 
limit to $4,644,920,800, an increase of $319,035,100.
DRIVERS  AND MOTOR  VEHICLES
Noncitizen driver [s licenses
Under 2007 Wisconsin Act 20, certain provisions specified in the federal 
REAL ID Act of 2005 (REAL ID) were incorporated into state law, and these 
provisions became effective on January 1, 2013.  Among these provisions was the 
requirement that DOT follow certain procedures in processing applications for 
driver[s licenses and identification cards.  However, under 2011 Wisconsin Acts 23 
and 32, DOT may process applications for driver [s licenses and identification cards 
in a manner other than that required by REAL ID if the driver [s licenses and 
identification cards are marked to indicate that they are not REAL ID compliant 
and DOT processes the applications in compliance with DOT practices and 
procedures applicable immediately prior to implementation of REAL ID.
Under current law, an applicant for a driver [s license or identification card, 
regardless of whether it is REAL ID compliant or REAL ID noncompliant, must 
provide to DOT 1) an identification document that includes either the applicant [s 
photograph or both the applicant [s full legal name and date of birth; 2) 
documentation, which may be the same as item 1, above, showing the applicant [s 
date of birth; 3) proof of the applicant [s social security number or verification that 
the applicant is not eligible for a social security number; 4) documentation showing 
the applicant [s name and address of principal residence; and 5) documentary proof 
that the applicant is a U.S. citizen or is otherwise lawfully present in the United 
States.  However, in processing an application for a REAL ID noncompliant driver [s 
license or identification card, DOT is not required to meet the standards for 
document retention and verification that are imposed for REAL ID compliant 
products.
Under the bill, an applicant for a REAL ID noncompliant driver [s license or 
identification card (noncompliant REAL ID) is not required to provide documentary 
proof that the applicant is a U.S. citizen or is otherwise lawfully present in the 
United States.  Also, an applicant may, in lieu of item 1 above, provide an individual 
taxpayer identification number, a foreign passport, or any other documentation 
deemed acceptable to DOT and, in lieu of items 2 and 4 above, provide 
documentation deemed acceptable to DOT.  If the applicant does not have a social 
security number, the applicant is required to provide verification only that he or she 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 195 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
does not have one, rather than verification that he or she is not eligible for one.  In 
processing an application for, and issuing or renewing, a noncompliant REAL ID, 
DOT may not include any question or require any proof or documentation as to 
whether the applicant is a U.S. citizen or is otherwise lawfully present in the 
United States.  The license document issued must display, on its face, the words 
XNot valid for voting purposes.  Not evidence of citizenship or immigration status. Y  
The bill does not change any current law requirements related to driver 
qualifications such as minimum age or successful completion of knowledge and 
driving skills tests.
With limited exceptions, DOT may not disclose social security numbers 
obtained from operator [s license or identification card applicants.  The bill prohibits 
DOT from disclosing the fact that an applicant has verified to DOT that the 
applicant does not have a social security number, except that DOT may disclose this 
information to the Elections Commission.
The bill also prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person [s status as a 
holder or a nonholder of a noncompliant REAL ID, adding this license status as a 
prohibited basis for discrimination in employment, housing, and the equal 
enjoyment of a public place of accommodation or amusement.
Authorizing special group plates
Under current law, members of certain designated special groups may obtain 
from DOT special registration plates for certain vehicles that are owned or leased by 
special group members.  A fee, in addition to the regular registration fee for the 
particular kind of vehicle, is charged for the issuance or reissuance of most special 
plates.
The bill establishes two special groups: persons wishing to have Xblackout Y 
registration plates and persons wishing to have XretroY registration plates.  The bill 
requires that plates issued to members of the Xblackout Y special group have a black 
background and white lettering displaying the word XWisconsin Y and the 
registration number assigned to the vehicle.  The bill requires that plates issued to 
members of the XretroY special group have a yellow background and black lettering 
displaying the words XAmerica [s Dairyland Y and XWisconsin Y and the registration 
number assigned to the vehicle.
The bill provides that, in addition to the required fees, special group members 
are required to make a voluntary payment of $25 to be issued the special plates.  
Under the bill, DOT retains $23,700, or the actual initial costs of production, 
whichever is less, from the voluntary payment moneys for the initial costs of 
production of the special plates.  The remainder of the voluntary payment amounts 
are deposited in the transportation fund.
Title fees increase
Under current law, the owner of a vehicle subject to registration must apply to 
DOT for a certificate of title for the vehicle when the person first acquires or 
registers the vehicle.  The bill increases from $157 to $277 the fees for a first 
certificate of title and a certificate of a title after transfer.2025 - 2026  Legislature

Operator license fee increase
Under current law, a person must pay DOT a specified fee for issuance, 
renewal, upgrading, and reinstatement of licenses, endorsements, and instruction 
permits.  The bill increases from $24 to $32.50 the fee for a license, other than a 
probationary license, for the operation of XClass DY motor vehicles.
Driver education grant program funding
Under current law, DOT administers a program to make grants to providers of 
driver education courses, and moneys are appropriated to DOT from the 
transportation fund for that purpose.  Under current law, moneys are appropriated 
to OCI for general program operations.  At the end of each fiscal year, the 
unencumbered balance in that appropriation account that exceeds 10 percent of the 
fiscal year [s expenditures from that appropriation account lapses to the general 
fund.
The bill modifies the DOT appropriation to be from the general fund, from the 
amounts lapsed from the OCI appropriation account, but not to exceed $6,000,000 
in a fiscal year.
RAIL AND AIR TRANSPORTATION
Attaching Office of the Commissioner of Railroads to DOT
The bill attaches the Office of the Commissioner of Railroads to DOT for 
administrative purposes.  Under current law, the office primarily regulates the 
safety of rail-highway crossings and is attached to PSC for administrative purposes.
Freight rail preservation bonding
Under current law, the state may contract up to $300,300,000 in public debt 
for DOT to acquire railroad property, provide grants and loans for railroad property 
acquisition and improvement, and provide intermodal freight facilities grants.  The 
bill increases the authorized general obligation bonding limit for these purposes by 
$5,000,000, to $305,300,000.
GENERAL  TRANSPORTATION
Regional transit authorities
The bill authorizes the creation of a regional transit authority (RTA) in any 
metropolitan statistical area in which qualifying political subdivisions agree to 
create one.  Upon creation, each regional transit authority is a public body corporate 
and politic and a separate governmental entity.
An RTA is created if any two or more political subdivisions located within a 
metropolitan statistical area adopt resolutions authorizing the political subdivision 
to become members of the RTA.  Once created, the members of an RTA consist of all 
political subdivisions that adopt resolutions authorizing participation.  Any 
political subdivision located in whole or in part within a metropolitan statistical 
area located in whole or in part within an RTA [s jurisdiction may join the RTA.  The 
jurisdictional area of an RTA created under the bill is the geographic area formed 
by the combined territorial boundaries of all participating political subdivisions.  A 
member political subdivision may withdraw from an RTA if the governing body of 2025 - 2026  Legislature
ASSEMBLY BILL 50- 197 - LRB-2080/1
ALL:all
the political subdivision adopts a resolution requesting withdrawal from the RTA 
and the political subdivision has paid, or made provision for the payment of, all 
obligations of the political subdivision to the RTA.
An RTA [s authority is vested in its board of directors.  Directors serve four-
year terms.  An RTA [s bylaws govern its management, operations, and 
administration and must include provisions specifying all of the following:
1.  The functions or services to be provided by the RTA.
2.  The powers, duties, and limitations of the RTA.
3.  The maximum rate of the sales and use tax, not exceeding the statutory 
limit, that may be imposed by the RTA.
An RTA may do all of the following:
1.  Establish or acquire a comprehensive unified local transportation system, 
which is a transportation system comprising bus lines and other public 
transportation facilities generally within the jurisdictional area of the RTA.  
XTransportation system Y is defined to include land, structures, equipment, and 
other property for transportation of passengers, including by bus, rail, or other form 
of mass transportation.  The RTA may operate this transportation system or 
provide for its operation by another.  The RTA may contract with a public or private 
organization to provide transportation services in lieu of directly providing these 
services and may purchase and lease transportation facilities to public or private 
transit companies.  With two exceptions, an RTA may not directly or by contract 
provide service outside the RTA [s jurisdictional area.
2.  Coordinate specialized transportation services for persons who are disabled 
or age 60 or older.
3.  Own or lease real or personal property.
4.  Acquire property by condemnation.
5.  Enter upon highways to install, maintain, and operate the RTA [s facilities.
6.  Impose, by the adoption of a resolution by the RTA [s board of directors, a 
sales and use tax in the RTA [s jurisdictional area at a rate of not more than 0.5 
percent of the sales price.
7.  Impose a fee of $2 per transaction on the rental of passenger cars without 
drivers.
8.  Incur debts and obligations.  An RTA may issue tax-exempt revenue bonds, 
secured by a pledge of any income or revenues from any operations or other source of 
moneys for the RTA.  The bonds of an RTA are not a debt of its member political 
subdivisions and neither the member political subdivisions nor the state are liable 
for the payment of the bonds.
9.  Set fees and charges for functions, facilities, and services provided by the 
RTA.
10.  Adopt bylaws and rules to carry out the powers and purposes of the RTA.
11.  Sue and be sued in its own name.
12.  Employ agents, consultants, and employees; engage professional services; 2025 - 2026  Legislature

and purchase furniture, supplies, and materials reasonably necessary to perform 
its duties and exercise its powers.
13.  Invest funds not required for immediate disbursement.
14.  Do and perform any authorized acts by means of an agent or by contracts 
with any person.
15.  Exercise any other powers that the board of directors considers necessary 
and convenient to effectuate the purposes of the RTA, including providing for 
passenger safety.
The board of directors of an RTA must annually prepare a budget for the RTA. 
Rates and other charges received by the RTA may be used only for the general 
expenses and capital expenditures of the RTA, to pay interest, amortization, and 
retirement charges on the RTA [s revenue bonds, and for specific purposes of the 
RTA and may not be transferred to any political subdivision.  The RTA must 
maintain an accounting system in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles and must have its financial statements and debt covenants audited 
annually by an independent certified public accountant.
An RTA must provide, or contract for the provision of, transit service within 
the RTA [s jurisdictional area.  An RTA that acquires a transportation system for the 
purpose of operating the system must assume all of the employer [s obligations 
under any contract between the employees and management of the system to the 
extent allowed by law.  An RTA that acquires, constructs, or operates a 
transportation system must negotiate an agreement with the representative of the 
labor organization that covers the employees affected by the acquisition, 
construction, or operation to protect the interests of employees affected, and that 
agreement must include specified provisions.  Employees of the RTA are 
participatory employees under the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) if the RTA 
elects to join the WRS.
Current law provides limited immunity for cities, villages, towns, counties, 
and other political corporations and governmental subdivisions, and for officers, 
officials, agents, and employees of these entities, for acts done in an official capacity 
or in the course of employment.  Claimants must generally follow a specified claims 
procedure and liability for damages is generally limited to $50,000 except that no 
liability may be imposed for performance of a discretionary duty or for punitive 
damages.  If a person suffers damage resulting from the negligent operation of a 
motor vehicle owned and operated by a county, city, village, town, school district, 
sewer district, or other political subdivision of the state in the course of its business, 
the person may file a claim for damages following this claims procedure and the 
amount of damages recoverable is limited to $250,000.  The bill specifies that this 
provision related to claims and liability for negligent operation of a motor vehicle by 
a political subdivision applies to an RTA.
The bill also allows RTAs to participate in organizing municipal insurance 
mutuals to provide insurance and risk management services.2025 - 2026  Legislature

The bill requires DOT to establish a transit capital assistance grant program, 
under which DOT awards grants to eligible applicants for the replacement of public 
transit vehicles.
Certification grants under the transportation infrastructure loan program
Under current law, DOT administers a transportation infrastructure loan 
program.  Under the program, DOT provides loans and other assistance to eligible 
applicants for highway and transit capital projects.  When loans under the program 
are repaid, the moneys are again made available for loan or other assistance under 
the program.
The bill specifies that, if DOT finds that special circumstances exist, DOT may 
award a grant to an eligible applicant under the program for the purpose of 
engaging a certified public accountant to make any certifications or attestations 
required by DOT as a condition of receiving a loan or other assistance under the 
program.
Determination of grant ceiling for TEA grants
Under current law, DOT administers a transportation facilities economic 
assistance and development program (TEA). Under TEA, DOT may improve a 
highway, airport, or harbor, or provide other assistance for the improvement of such 
transportation facilities or certain rail property or railroad tracks, as part of an 
economic development project.  DOT may also make loans for the improvement of 
any of these transportation facilities.  The state share of costs for the improvement 
of any transportation facility (grant ceiling) may generally not exceed the lesser of 
50 percent of the cost of the improvement or $5,000 for each job resulting from the 
improvement or the economic development project.
The bill increases the dollar amount for each job resulting from the 
improvement or project used in calculating the grant ceiling to $15,000.
Auto parts and repair transfer to the transportation fund
The bill requires a transfer from the general fund to the transportation fund in 
each fiscal year, beginning on June 30, 2025.  The amount of the transfer must be 
equal to the marginal difference between the sales tax generated from the sale of 
automotive parts, accessories, tires, and repair and maintenance services in fiscal 
year 2019-20 and the fiscal year of the transfer, as calculated by DOA.
Transfer from forestry account to transportation fund
The bill transfers $25,000,000 from the forestry account of the conservation

all OWI offenses that involve the use of alcohol.
VETERANS
Veterans assistance
Under current law, DVA administers the assistance to needy veterans grant 
program, which provides subsistence aid and health care aid to veterans.  Under 
the program, DVA may provide up to $3,000 in subsistence aid per 12-month period 
to veterans who have suffered a loss of income due to illness, injury, or natural 
disaster.  Under the program, DVA may also provide aid payments to a veteran to 
pay for dental care, hearing care, and vision care.  The total lifetime limit that a 
veteran may receive in aid under the program is $7,500.
The bill expands the program by allowing DVA to provide subsistence aid 
payments, in an amount of up to $5,000 per 12-month period, to a veteran who has 
suffered a loss of income for any reason and allows DVA to provide health care aid 
payments to pay for any medical device prescribed by a licensed health care 
provider.  The bill also raises the total lifetime limit that a veteran may receive in

armed forces of the United States at any time during the period from February 28, 
1961, to September 18, 1978, and who is a citizen of the United States or a lawful 
permanent resident of the United States.  The bill extends most veterans benefits to 
anyone who meets this newly expanded definition of veteran; however, admission to 
a state veterans home and burial in a veterans cemetery are not included benefits 
as they are subject to federal regulation.
Veterans service officer grants
The bill increases the dollar amount of veteran service officer grants made to 
counties and governing bodies of federally recognized American Indian tribes and 
bands.
Under current law, DVA is required to annually award a grant to a county that 
employs a certain elected or appointed county veterans service officer.  The grant is 
awarded for the purpose of improving a county [s services to veterans and varies in 
amount depending on the county [s population.  A county that employs a part-time 
county veterans service officer is eligible to receive an annual grant not exceeding 
$550.  DVA may also make annual grants to the governing body of a federally 
recognized American Indian tribe or band if the tribal governing body appoints a 
tribal veterans service officer and enters into an agreement with DVA regarding 
the creation, goals, and objectives of the tribal veterans service officer position.
The bill increases the dollar amount of the veterans service officer grants 
awarded to counties in the following ways:  1) for counties with a population of less 
than 20,000, the grant is increased from $11,688 to $12,300; 2) for counties with a 
population of 20,000 to 45,499, the grant is increased from $13,750 to $14,400; 3) for 
counties with a population of 45,500 to 74,999, the grant is increased from $15,813 
to $16,600; and 4) for counties with a population of 75,000 or more, the grant is 
increased from $17,875 to $18,800.  The bill also increases the dollar amount of the 
grant awarded to tribal governing bodies from $20,625 to $21,700.  In addition, the 
bill eliminates the restriction on a grant for a county employing a part-time county 
veterans services officer.

criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts as the facts upon which the 
action is based, the court may stay such discovery in whole or in part for a period of 
not more than 60 days.  The court may extend the period of any such stay upon a

criminal or civil investigation of the matter with reasonable diligence and the 
proposed discovery in the action brought under sub. (5) will interfere with the 
ongoing criminal or civil investigation or prosecution.

relating to the same acts under sub. (10), the person who brings the action shall 
receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action 
or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person

the civil penalty and damages.  The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and

upon which the action or proceeding is based, then the court may, to the extent that 
the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action that 
the person would otherwise receive under par. (a), (b), or (d), taking into account the

funded private construction projects to be paid the prevailing wage rate and to be 
paid at least 1.5 times their hourly basic rate of pay for hours worked in excess of the 
prevailing hours of labor would be logically inconsistent with, would defeat the

s. 66.0904, 2009 stats., and s. 66.0903 (2) to (12), 2013 stats.  Therefore, this section 
shall be construed as an enactment of statewide concern for the purposes of 
facilitating broader participation with respect to bidding on projects of public 
works, ensuring that wages accurately reflect market conditions, providing local 
governments with the flexibility to reduce costs on capital projects, and reducing 
spending at all levels of government in this state purpose of providing uniform 
prevailing wage rate and prevailing hours of labor requirements throughout the 
state.1

addition to the current prevailing wage rates, include future prevailing wage rates 
when those prevailing wage rates can be determined for any trade or occupation in 
any area and shall specify the effective date of those future prevailing wage rates.  
If a project of public works extends into more than one area, the department shall

(c)  In addition to the recalculation under par. (b), the state agency that 
requested the determination under this subsection may request a review of any 
portion of a determination within 30 days after the date of issuance of the 
determination if the state agency submits evidence with the request showing that 
the prevailing wage rate for any given trade or occupation included in the 
determination does not represent the prevailing wage rate for that trade or 
occupation in the city, village, or town in which the proposed project of public works 
is located.  That evidence shall include wage rate information for the contested 
trade or occupation on at least 3 similar projects located in the city, village, or town

mutually satisfactory employment relations and the availability of suitable 
machinery for the peaceful adjustment of whatever controversies may arise.  It is 
recognized that certain employers, including farmers, farmer cooperatives, and 
unincorporated farmer cooperative associations, in addition to their general 
employer problems, face special problems arising from perishable commodities and 
seasonal production that require adequate consideration.  It is also recognized that 
whatever may be the rights of disputants with respect to each other in any 
controversy regarding employment relations, they should not be permitted, in the 
conduct of their controversy, to intrude directly into the primary rights of 3rd 
parties to earn a livelihood, transact business, and engage in the ordinary affairs of 
life by any lawful means and free from molestation, interference, restraint, or 
coercion.
(3)  Negotiations of terms and conditions of work should result from voluntary 
agreement between employer and employee.  For the purpose of such negotiation an 
employee has the right, if the employee desires, to associate with others in 
organizing and bargaining collectively through representatives of the employee [s 
own choosing, without intimidation or coercion from any source.
(4)  It is the policy of the state, in order to preserve and promote the interests 
of the public, the employee, and the employer alike, to establish standards of fair 
conduct in employment relations and to provide a convenient, expeditious, and 
impartial tribunal by which these interests may have their respective rights and 
obligations adjudicated.  While limiting individual and group rights of aggression 1

right of either party to the all-union agreement to petition the commission to

the fair-share agreement be terminated.  Upon so finding, the commission shall 
conduct a referendum.  If the continuation of the agreement is not supported by at 
least the majority of the eligible employees, it shall terminate.  The commission 
shall declare any fair-share agreement suspended upon such conditions and for 
such time as the commission decides whenever it finds that the labor organization

SECTION  3023
the marriage contract are more significant to society than those of other contracts, 
and the public interest must be taken into account always.  The seriousness of 
marriage makes adequate premarital counseling and education for family living 
highly desirable and courses thereon are urged upon all persons contemplating 
marriage.  The impairment or dissolution of the marriage relation generally results 
in injury to the public wholly apart from the effect upon the parties immediately 
concerned.  Under the laws of this state, marriage is a legal relationship between 2 
equal persons, a husband and wife, who owe to each other mutual responsibility 
and support.  Each spouse has an equal obligation in accordance with his or her 
ability to contribute money or services or both which are necessary for the adequate 
support and maintenance of his or her minor children and of the other spouse.  No 
spouse may be presumed primarily liable for support expenses under this 
subsection.
SECTION  3024 .  765.01 of the statutes is amended to read:
765.01   A civil contract.   Marriage, so far as its validity at law is concerned, 
is a civil contract, to which the consent of the parties capable in law of contracting 
is essential, and which creates the legal status of husband and wife spouse to each 
other.
SECTION  3025 .  765.02 (3) of the statutes is created to read:
765.02 (3)  Marriage may be contracted between persons of the same sex or 
different sexes.

husband or wife spouse living, nor between persons who are nearer of kin than 2nd 
cousins except that marriage may be contracted between first cousins where the 
female has attained the age of 55 years or where if either party, at the time of 
application for a marriage license, submits an affidavit signed by a physician 
stating that either party is permanently sterile or that the 2 parties are otherwise 
permanently biologically incapable of producing a child together.  Relationship 
under this section shall be computed by the rule of the civil law, whether the parties 
to the marriage are of the half or of the whole blood.  A marriage may not be 
contracted if either party has such want of understanding as renders him or her 
incapable of assenting to marriage.
SECTION  3027 .  765.16 (1m) (intro.) of the statutes is amended to read:
765.16 (1m)  (intro.)  Marriage may be validly solemnized and contracted in 
this state only after a marriage license has been issued therefor, and only by the 
mutual declarations of the 2 parties to be joined in marriage that they take each 
takes the other as husband and wife his or her spouse, made before an authorized 
officiating person and in the presence of at least 2 competent adult witnesses other 
than the officiating person.  If one of the parties is serving on active duty in the U.S. 
armed forces or in forces incorporated in the U.S. armed forces, in a reserve unit of 
the U.S. armed forces, or in the national guard, the presence of only one competent 
adult witness other than the officiating person is required.  The following are 
authorized to be officiating persons:

SECTION  3029 .  765.23 of the statutes is amended to read:
765.23   Immaterial irregularities otherwise.   No marriage hereafter 
contracted shall be void either by reason of the marriage license having been issued 
by a county clerk not having jurisdiction to issue the same; or by reason of any 
informality or irregularity of form in the application for the marriage license or in 
the marriage license itself, or the incompetency of the witnesses to such marriage; 
or because the marriage may have been solemnized more than 60 days after the 
date of the marriage license, if the marriage is in other respects lawful and is 
consummated with the full belief on the part of the persons so married, or either of 
them, that they have been lawfully joined in marriage.  Where a marriage has been 
celebrated in one of the forms provided for in s. 765.16 (1m), and the parties thereto 
have immediately thereafter assumed the habit and repute of husband and wife a 
married couple, and having continued the same uninterruptedly thereafter for the 
period of one year, or until the death of either of them, it shall be deemed that a 
marriage license has been issued as required by ss. 765.05 to 765.24 and 767.803.
SECTION  3030 .  765.24 of the statutes is amended to read:
765.24   Removal of impediments to subsequent marriage.   If a person 
during the lifetime of a husband or wife spouse with whom the marriage is in force, 
enters into a subsequent marriage contract in accordance with s. 765.16, and the

pretrial hearing.  The court may direct and, if requested by either party before the

pretrial hearing may in any such case be read in evidence if it is competent, 
relevant, and material.  The issues of child support, custody, and visitation, and 
related issues shall be determined by the court either immediately after the first 
part of the trial or at a later hearing before the court.

SECTION  9151
(2) (c), 943.201 (1) (b) 8., and 943.205 (2) (b), and the creation of ss. 69.15 (3) (b) 3m., 
765.02 (3), 891.40 (1) (b) and (3), 891.41 (3), and 990.01 (22h), (39), and (40m), and 
the repeal and recreation of s. 29.563 (3) (a) 3. (as it relates to gendered references) 
to harmonize the language of the Wisconsin statutes relating to marriage and the 
determination of parentage with the provision of s. 990.001 (2), which specifies that 
words importing one gender extend and may be applied to any gender.  The 
legislature intends that by amending the statutes relating to marriage and the 
determination of parentage with respect to married couples to use gender neutral 
language where appropriate so as to clarify that the same statutory rights and 
responsibilities apply between married persons of the same sex as between married 
persons of different sexes and to extend some of the presumptions of paternity to 
either parent, the Wisconsin statutes will be better aligned with the holding of the 
U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges , 135 S. Ct. 2584, 192 L. Ed. 2d 609 
(2015), which recognizes that same-sex couples have a fundamental constitutional 
right to marriage.
(2)  D ELAYED  PENALTY  APPLICATION  FOR VIOLATING  PROHIBITION .  
Notwithstanding s. 941.285, no person may be subject to a penalty for violating s.

section for the first 180 days after the effective date of this subsection.
(3)  R EAL ESTATE  CONDITION  REPORTS ; DISCLOSURES  RELATED  TO FLOODING .
