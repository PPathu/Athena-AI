Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
  EXPLANATION OF PROPOSAL   
 This proposed constitutional amendment, to be given second consideration by 
the 2025 legislature for submittal to the voters in April 2025, was first considered 
by the 2023 legislature in 2023 Senate Joint Resolution 73, which became 2023 
Enrolled Joint Resolution 9.
This constitutional amendment provides that a qualified elector may not vote 
in any election unless the elector presents photographic identification issued by this 
state, by the federal government, by a federally recognized American Indian tribe or 
band in this state, or by a college or university in this state, that verifies the 
elector’s identity.  Acceptable forms of photographic identification must be specified 
by law.  The amendment authorizes the legislature to pass laws establishing 
exceptions to the photographic identification requirement.  Additionally, if an 
elector is unable to present valid photographic identification before voting on 
election day, the elector must be given the opportunity to cast a provisional ballot 
and present valid photographic identification at a later time and place, as provided 
by law.2025 - 2026  Legislature - 2 - LRB-0979/1

  PROCEDURE FOR SECOND CONSIDERATION   
 When a proposed constitutional amendment is before the legislature on 
second consideration, any change in the text approved by the preceding legislature 
causes the proposed constitutional amendment to revert to first consideration 
status so that second consideration approval would have to be given by the next 
legislature before the proposal may be submitted to the people for ratification [see 
joint rule 57 (2)]. 
 If the legislature approves a proposed constitutional amendment on second 
consideration, it must also set the date for submitting the proposed constitutional 
amendment to the people for ratification and must determine the question or 
questions to appear on the ballot.
Whereas, the 2023 legislature in regular session considered a proposed 
amendment to the constitution in 2023 Senate Joint Resolution 73, which became 
2023 Enrolled Joint Resolution 9, and agreed to it by a majority of the members 
elected to each of the two houses, which proposed amendment reads as follows:
SECTION  1.  Section 1m of article III of the constitution is created to 
read:
[Article III] Section 1m (1)  No qualified elector may cast a ballot in 
any election unless the elector presents valid photographic identification 
that verifies the elector’s identity and that is issued by this state, the 
federal government, a federally recognized American Indian tribe or 
band in this state, or a college or university in this state.  The legislature 
shall by law establish acceptable forms of photographic identification, 
and the legislature may by law establish exceptions to the requirement 
under this subsection.
(2)  A qualified elector who is unable to present valid photographic 
identification on election day shall be permitted to cast a provisional 
ballot.  A provisional ballot may not be counted unless the elector 
presents valid photographic identification at a later time and place as 
provided by the legislature by law.
SECTION  2.  Numbering of new provision.  If another 
constitutional amendment ratified by the people creates the number of 
any provision created in this joint resolution, the chief of the legislative 
reference bureau shall determine the sequencing and the numbering of 
the provisions whose numbers conflict.
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the assembly , the senate  concurring, 2025 - 2026  Legislature - 3 - LRB-0979/1
