AN ACT to renumber and amend  710.02 (1) and 710.02 (9); to amend  710.02 
(2) (intro.), 710.02 (3), 710.02 (5) (a) (intro.), 710.02 (5) (a) 1., 710.02 (5) (a) 2. 
and 710.02 (6); to create  710.02 (1g), 710.02 (1r) (d) and 710.02 (9) (b) of the 
statutes; relating to:  prohibiting a foreign adversary from acquiring 
agricultural or forestry land in this state.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill generally prohibits a foreign adversary from acquiring agricultural or 
forestry land in this state.  In the bill, Xforeign adversary Y means a foreign 
government or nongovernment person determined by the federal secretary of 
commerce to have engaged in a long-term pattern or serious instances of conduct 
significantly adverse to the national security of the United States or security and 
safety of U.S. persons.
Current law generally prohibits a nonresident alien or a corporation that is 
not created under federal law or the laws of any state (foreign person) from 
acquiring, owning, or holding more than 640 acres of land in this state.  However, 
that prohibition does not apply to any of the following activities:
1.  An exploration mining lease and land used for certain mining and 
associated activities.1

2.  Certain manufacturing activities.
3.  Certain mercantile activities.
4.  A lease for exploration or production of oil, gas, coal, shale, and related 
hydrocarbons, including by-products of the production, and land used in connection 
with the exploration or production.
Those exceptions have been interpreted to be Xextremely broad, embracing 
almost every conceivable business activity [other than a]ctivities relating to 
agriculture and forestry. Y  See Opinion of Wis. Att [y Gen., OAG 11-14, Â‡5, available 
at https://www.doj.state.wi.us.  In other words, under current law, a foreign person 
may acquire, own, and hold unlimited amounts of land for most nonagricultural 
and nonforestry purposes, but a foreign person may not acquire, own, or hold more 
than 640 acres of land for agricultural or forestry purposes.
The bill retains the current law restriction on foreign person ownership of 
agricultural and forestry land and adds a provision that prohibits a foreign 
adversary from acquiring any land for agricultural or forestry purposes.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
SECTION  1.  710.02 (1) of the statutes is renumbered 710.02 (1r) and amended
