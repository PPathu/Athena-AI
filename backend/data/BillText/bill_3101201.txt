AN ACT to amend  71.07 (9e) (b); to create  71.07 (9e) (ar) of the statutes; 
relating to:  allowing certain married persons to claim the earned income tax 
credit when filing a separate return.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, the Wisconsin earned income tax credit is equal to a 
percentage of the federal earned income tax credit, and subject to certain 
exceptions, a married claimant must file a joint return to claim both the Wisconsin 
EITC and the federal EITC.  This bill allows a married claimant to file a separate 
return to claim the Wisconsin EITC if the claimant lives apart from the claimant [s 
spouse when filing the return and is unable to file a joint return because of 
domestic abuse.  The bill defines Xdomestic abuse Y as 1) intentional infliction of 
physical pain, injury, or illness; 2) intentional impairment of physical condition; 3) 
first-, second-, or third-degree sexual assault; or 4) a physical act that may cause 
reasonable fear of imminent engagement in any of the conduct listed above.  Under 
the bill, the amount of the Wisconsin EITC is equal to the amount that the claimant 
would be eligible to claim if the claimant were considered unmarried.

an appendix to this bill.1
