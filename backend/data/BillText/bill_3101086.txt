and 49.471 (7) (b) 1. of the statutes; relating to:  extension of eligibility under 
the Medical Assistance program for postpartum women.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill requires the Department of Health Services to seek approval from 
the federal Department of Health and Human Services to extend until the last day 
of the month in which the 365th day after the last day of the pregnancy falls 
Medical Assistance benefits to women who are eligible for those benefits when 
pregnant.  Currently, postpartum women are eligible for Medical Assistance 
benefits until the last day of the month in which the 60th day after the last day of 
the pregnancy falls.  2021 Wisconsin Act 58 required DHS to seek approval from the 
federal Department of Health and Human Services to extend these postpartum 
Medical Assistance benefits until the last day of the month in which the 90th day 
after the last day of the pregnancy falls.  On June 3, 2022, DHS filed a Section 1115 
Demonstration Waiver application with the federal Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services to extend postpartum coverage for eligible Medical Assistance 
recipients, as required by 2021 Wisconsin Act 58.  The Medical Assistance program 
is a joint federal and state program that provides health services to individuals who 
have limited financial resources.1
