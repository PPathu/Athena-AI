establishment of a Palliative Care Council.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill establishes within the Department of Health Services a Palliative 
Care Council, which includes as members a statewide group of medical and clinical 
professionals with expertise in the provision of palliative care services, as well as 
patients or family members of patients who have experience receiving palliative 
care services, to advise DHS about palliative care issues.
The bill requires the council to consult with and advise DHS regarding 1) 
outcome evaluation of established palliative care programs; 2) the economic and 
quality of life effectiveness of palliative care that is provided along with curative 
treatment; 3) the mechanisms for and adequacy of reimbursement for palliative 
care services; and 4) any other issues relating to palliative care arising through 
meetings or discussions, as the council determines appropriate.  The bill provides 
that the council may not consult with or advise DHS on physician-assisted suicide, 
euthanasia, medical aid in dying, or any other act that would condone, authorize, 
approve, or permit any affirmative or deliberate act to end life other than the 
withholding or withdrawing of health care under an advance directive or power of 
attorney for health care so as to permit the natural process of dying.  Under the bill, 
DHS must, in consultation with the council, establish a statewide palliative care 
consumer and professional information and education program to ensure that 1

provides that DHS must make certain information and resources regarding 
palliative care available on its website.  Under the bill, the council must submit 
reports to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature providing its 
analysis on the issues of access to palliative care and the impact of palliative care on 
health care delivery systems in this state and on families that have experience with 
palliative care services.
