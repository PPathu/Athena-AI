Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, any person who moves a corpse for the purpose of final 
disposition must file a death record for the corpse in a manner prescribed by the 
state registrar when the death occurred in this state, the corpse was found in this 
state, or certain other circumstances apply.  For purposes of preparing the death 
record, certain health care providers may pronounce the date, time, and place of the 
death in certain circumstances, including naturopathic doctors and physician 
assistants.  This bill allows advanced practice nurse prescribers who are directly 
involved with the care of a patient who dies to pronounce the date, time, and place 
of the patient [s death for purposes of preparation of the death record.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
