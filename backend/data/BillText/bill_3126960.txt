  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  341.145 (3) of the statutes; relating to:  personalized 
registration plate fees for gold star family special registration plates.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill exempts special group plates for gold star families from personalized 
registration plate fees.
Current law enumerates special groups whose members may obtain from the 
Department of Transportation special motor vehicle registration plates.  Among the 
special groups is a group for persons who qualify under federal law for a gold star 
lapel button (commonly known as gold star family), which signifies that the 
recipient is the immediate family member of a member of the U.S. armed forces who 
died while serving during a time of conflict.  Special group plates may be 
personalized by the person to whom the plates are issued.
Under current law, DOT collects a registration fee for initial and renewal 
registrations of most motor vehicles.  In addition to the regular registration fee, 
DOT charges an annual fee of $15 for the issuance or reissuance of most special 
registration plates and an additional annual fee of $15 for the issuance, 
maintenance, or reissuance of most personalized plates.
Under current law, gold star special registration plate holders must pay the 
general registration fee, but are not assessed the special registration fee.  If the 
plate holder personalizes the plate, he or she is assessed the $15 personalization 1
