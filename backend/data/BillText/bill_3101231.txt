MJW:cjs
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
SEXUAL ASSAULT OF AN ADULT AT RISK
Under this bill, any act of sexual misconduct that is currently a second degree 
sexual assault is a first degree sexual assault if the victim is an adult at risk.  
Under current law, if a person engages in any of the specified acts of sexual 
misconduct, he or she is guilty of a Class C felony.  Under the bill, he or she is guilty 
of a Class B felony if the victim is an adult at risk, regardless of whether or not he or 
she knew the victim [s status as an adult at risk.
FREEZING OF ASSETS
Under current law, there is a procedure for a court to freeze or seize assets 
from a defendant who has been charged with a financial exploitation crime when 
the victim is an elder person.  The procedure allows a court to freeze the funds, 
assets, or property of the defendant in an amount up to 100 percent of the alleged 
value of the property involved in the defendant [s pending criminal proceeding for 
purposes of preserving the property for future payment of restitution to the crime 
victim.
This bill allows the court to apply the same procedure to freeze or seize assets 
when the crime victim an adult at risk.
PHYSICAL ABUSE OF AN ADULT AT RISK
Under current law, there is a set of penalties that apply to physical abuse of an 
elder person, which range from a Class I felony to a Class C felony depending on the 
severity of the conduct.  This bill applies those same penalties to physical abuse of 
an adult at risk.
INCREASED PENALTIES
This bill allows a term of imprisonment that is imposed for a criminal 
conviction to be increased in length if the crime victim was an adult at risk.  Under 
the bill, a maximum term of imprisonment of one year or less may be increased to 
two years; a maximum term of imprisonment of one to 10 years may be increased by 
up to four years; and a maximum term of imprisonment of more than 10 years may 
be increased by up to six years.  Under the bill, the term of imprisonment may be 
lengthened irrespective of whether the defendant knew that the crime victim was 
an adult at risk.
RESTRAINING ORDERS FOR AN ADULT AT RISK
Under current law, a person seeking a domestic violence, individual-at-risk, or 
harassment restraining order must appear in person in the courtroom at a hearing 
to obtain a restraining order.
This bill allows an adult at risk who is seeking a domestic violence, individual-
at-risk, or harassment restraining order to appear in a court hearing by telephone 
or live audiovisual means.
Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, 2025 - 2026  Legislature
