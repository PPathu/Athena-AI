Representatives MELOTIK  and KNODL . Referred to Committee on 
Transportation and Local Government.
AN ACT to amend  341.14 (6r) (e) and 341.14 (6r) (fm) 7.; to create  341.14 (6r)

special registration plates with white lettering on a black background.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, members of certain designated special groups may obtain 
from the Department of Transportation special registration plates for certain 
vehicles that are owned or leased by special group members.  A fee, in addition to 
the regular registration fee for the particular kind of vehicle, is charged for the 
issuance or reissuance of most special plates.
This bill establishes a special group for persons wishing to have registration 
plates with white lettering on a black background. The bill requires that plates 
issued to members of the special group have a black background and white lettering 
displaying the word “Wisconsin” and the registration number assigned to the 
vehicle.
The bill provides that, in addition to the required fees, special group members 
are required to make a voluntary payment of $25 to be issued the special plates.  
Under the bill, DOT retains $23,700, or the actual initial costs of production, 
whichever is less, from the voluntary payment moneys for the initial costs of 
production of the special plates.  The remainder of the voluntary payment amounts 
are deposited in the transportation fund.2025 - 2026  Legislature
