AN ACT to amend  38.14 (2) (d) 1. of the statutes; relating to:  technical colleges [ 
lease of their facilities to others.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill allows a technical college to lease its facilities to others for the 
operation of a child care center.
Current law allows a technical college to rent to others property not needed for 
school purposes.  Before July 1, 1999, a technical college, with the approval of the 
Technical College System Board, could also lease its facilities to others for school 
purposes, but this is prohibited after June 30, 1999.
The bill creates an exception to this prohibition, allowing a technical college, 
with the approval of the TCS Board, to lease its facilities to others for the operation 
of a child care center.
For further information see the local fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do
