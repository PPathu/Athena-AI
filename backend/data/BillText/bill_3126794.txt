University of Wisconsin System or a technical college.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill modifies the residency requirement for the tuition and fee remission 
program for certain veterans and their spouses and children enrolled in University 
of Wisconsin System schools and technical colleges.
Under current law, if certain criteria are met, veterans and their spouses and 
17- to 25-year-old children are eligible for full remission of tuition and fees at UW 
System schools and technical colleges for up to eight semesters or 128 credits, 
whichever is longer.  Under the veterans fee remission program, the veteran must 
be a resident of this state when he or she entered military service or be a resident of 1

this state for at least five consecutive years immediately before the veteran registers 
at a UW System school or technical college.  Under the fee remission program for 
the spouse or child of a veteran who suffered service-connected death or disability, 
the veteran must have been a resident of this state when he or she entered military 
service or one of the following must apply:  1) if the veteran, while a resident of this 
state, died on active duty, died as the result of a service-connected disability, or died 
in the line of duty while on active or inactive duty for training purposes, the veteran 
must have resided in this state for at least five consecutive years while an adult, or 
2) if the veteran received at least a 30 percent service-connected disability rating, 
the veteran must have resided in this state for at least five consecutive years 
immediately before the veteran [s spouse or child registers at a UW System school or 
technical college.  In addition, if a veteran was not a resident of this state when he 
or she entered military service, the veteran [s spouse or child is eligible for tuition 
and fee remission only if the spouse or child has resided in this state for at least five 
consecutive years immediately before the spouse [s or child [s enrollment in a UW 
System school or technical college.
This bill eliminates the five-year durational residency requirement for 
veterans and their spouses and children under the tuition and fee remission 
program under circumstances in which the veteran was not a resident of this state 
when he or she entered military service.  Under the bill, if the veteran was not a 
resident of this state when he or she entered military service, the veteran is still 
eligible for the tuition and fee remission program if the veteran is a resident of this 
state immediately before the veteran registers at a UW System school or technical 
college.  Also under the bill, if the veteran was not a resident of this state when he 
or she entered military service, the veteran [s spouse and children are still eligible 
for the tuition and fee remission program if the spouse or child resided in this state 
immediately before the spouse or child registers at a UW System school or technical 
college and if the veteran, as described in 1), above, resided in this state at any time 
while an adult or the veteran, as described in 2), above, resided in this state 
immediately before the veteran [s spouse or child registers at a UW System school or 
technical college.  If the applicable requirements for fee remission are met, the 
veteran or the veteran [s spouse or child is eligible for fee remission regardless of 
whether the veteran or veteran [s spouse or child would otherwise qualify as a 
resident student for tuition or fee purposes.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.
