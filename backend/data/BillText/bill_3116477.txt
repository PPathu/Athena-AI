Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill permits a pharmacist to prescribe and dispense hormonal 
contraceptive patches and self-administered oral hormonal contraceptives, subject 
to limitations described as follows.
The bill requires the Pharmacy Examining Board, after consultation with the 
Medical Examining Board, the Board of Nursing, and the Department of Health 
Services, to promulgate rules to establish standard procedures for the prescribing 
of contraceptives by pharmacists under the bill.  The rules must require that 
pharmacists use a self-assessment questionnaire, developed in consideration of 
guidelines established by the American Congress of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, when prescribing a contraceptive.  The self-assessment 1

questionnaire must state and the patient must acknowledge on the self-assessment 
questionnaire that a hormonal contraceptive patch or a self-administered oral 
hormonal contraceptive is not protection against sexually transmitted diseases, and 
that it is strongly recommended that the patient annually meet with a physician or 
other medical professional to discuss the patient [s prescribed hormonal 
contraceptive treatment and other routine preventive care.
Under the bill, the rules promulgated by the Pharmacy Examining Board 
establishing standard procedures for the prescribing of contraceptives by 
pharmacists must include certain requirements for pharmacists such as requiring 
that the pharmacist report to the patient [s primary health care practitioner 
following a prescription and requiring that the contraceptive be dispensed as soon 
as practicable after the pharmacist issues the prescription order.  Further, the rules 
must prohibit a pharmacist from prescribing or dispensing a contraceptive to a 
patient unless the patient has responded to the self-assessment questionnaire and 
undergone a blood pressure screening and unless the use of the contraceptive is not 
contraindicated based upon the results of the questionnaire and screening.  A 
pharmacist who prescribes contraceptives as permitted under the bill must comply 
with those rules, as well as any other rules promulgated by the Pharmacy 
Examining Board.  A pharmacist may only prescribe a contraceptive to a person 
who is at least 18 years of age.
The bill requires any pharmacist who prescribes hormonal contraceptives as 
provided in the bill to have in effect malpractice liability insurance coverage in the 
amounts specified for other health care providers under current law.
Finally, the bill requires that DHS ensure any contraceptives or contraceptive 
services that are covered under the Medical Assistance program are covered and 
reimbursed when prescribed, if a prescription is required under federal law, or 
provided by a pharmacist acting within the scope of his or her practice.  The 
Medical Assistance program is a joint federal and state program that provides 
health services to individuals who have limited financial resources.  The bill also 
requires DHS to certify pharmacists as providers of Medical Assistance services for 
the purposes of covering and reimbursing prescribed hormonal contraceptive 
patches and self-administered oral hormonal contraceptives.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
