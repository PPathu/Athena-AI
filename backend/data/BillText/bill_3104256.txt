  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  66.0401 (1m) (intro.); to create  66.0401 (1r), 66.0401 (4) (h), 
196.49 (4m) and 196.491 (3) (d) 9. of the statutes; relating to:  requiring local 
approval for certain wind and solar projects before Public Service Commission 
approval.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Current law prohibits a person from beginning construction of a large electric 
generating facility (LEGF) unless the Public Service Commission grants a 
certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) for the proposed facility.  An 
LEGF is defined as a facility with a nominal operating capacity of 100 megawatts or 
more. In addition, a public utility may not engage in certain construction, 
expansion, or other projects unless PSC grants a certificate of authority (CA) for the 
proposed project. The bill defines a Xsolar project Y and Xwind project Y as an area of 
land on which, respectively, solar photovoltaic panels or devices used for collecting 
wind energy, along with any associated equipment and facilities, are installed in 
order to generate electricity and which altogether is designed for nominal operation 
at a capacity of 15 megawatts or more.
Under this bill, before PSC may approve a CA or a CPCN for the construction 
of a solar project or wind project, the person seeking the certificate must seek 
approval from each city, village, and town in which the solar project or wind project 1

is to be located.  The bill requires a city, village, or town to approve or disapprove a 
proposed solar project or wind project by adopting a resolution to that effect no later 
than 90 days after receiving a request for such approval.  If the city, village, or town 
fails to act within that time period, the project is considered approved.  The bill 
allows this deadline to be extended for certain reasons.  Current law limits the 
authority of political subdivisions to regulate solar and wind energy systems, 
allowing political subdivisions to impose restrictions only if they meet certain 
conditions.  The bill provides that those limitations do not apply to the approval or 
disapproval of a solar project or a wind project by a city, town, or village.  Current 
law also imposes procedures for political subdivisions that receive applications for 
approval relating to wind energy systems.  Those procedures do not apply to 
approval or disapproval of a wind project under the bill.
Under the bill, PSC may not issue a CPCN or CA for a solar project or wind 
project unless each city, village, and town in which the project is proposed to be 
located has adopted a resolution approving the project.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do
