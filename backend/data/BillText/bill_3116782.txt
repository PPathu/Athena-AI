Relating to:   proclaiming February 4, 2025, as Transit Equity Day.
Whereas, Rosa Parks was an iconic figure in the movements for social justice 
and racial equality and played a major role in the inception of the Civil Rights 
Movement that ended legal segregation in the United States; and
Whereas, the immediate focus of Rosa Parks [s historic protest was the 
unequal access of African Americans to public transit; and
Whereas, unequal access to public transit based on race, income, and 
disability has persisted to this day; and
Whereas, paratransit is a necessary component for any public transit system 
to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities who require it, and any expansion

provides an unprecedented opportunity to continue the tradition of Rosa Parks and 
the Civil Rights Movement by ensuring that transit systems are affordable and 
accessible and that people of color, economically disadvantaged people, people with 
disabilities, and other marginalized populations have full access to the benefits of 
public transit; and
Whereas, the expansion of public transit provides an unprecedented 
opportunity to create a large number of good, environmentally sustainable, high-
skill, family-supporting transit operation jobs, as well as construction jobs for 
building new transit facilities; and
Whereas, increased community access to public transit reduces racial, 
economic, and other disparities while building mobile equity within the community; 
now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the senate , the assembly  concurring, That the day of 
February 4, 2025, shall be designated as Transit Equity Day in Wisconsin.
