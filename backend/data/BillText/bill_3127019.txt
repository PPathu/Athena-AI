  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to create  1.14 (1) (am) and 1.14 (1m) of the statutes; relating to:  flags 
flown at state and local government buildings and eliminating a related 
administrative rule.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill prohibits any flag other than the U.S. flag, the state flag, the official 
POW/MIA flag recognized by Congress, and the official flags of each branch of the 
U.S. armed forces from being flown, hung, or displayed from any flagpole or 
building, structure, or facility, including the state capitol, that is owned or occupied 
entirely by a state agency or authority or by a city, village, town, or county.  
However, the bill authorizes the legislature to make exceptions for state flagpoles 
and facilities by joint resolution adopted by a three-fourths majority vote of all 
members elected to each house.  Similarly, a city, village, town, or county may make 
exceptions for its flagpoles and facilities by a three-fourths majority vote of all 
members elected to its governing body.
The bill also repeals an administrative rule that includes requirements 
similar to those of the bill but that authorizes the governor to make exceptions.  The 
bill delays its requirements for state flagpoles and facilities until January 1, 2027.1
