  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to renumber and amend  251.07; to amend  165.25 (6) (c), 251.07 
(title), 252.04 (9) and 895.46 (5) (b); to create  251.07 (1) and 252.01 (5) of the 
statutes; relating to:  state agency status for certain physician assistants and

health departments or school districts.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill provides that physician assistants and advanced practice nurse 
prescribers who are not employed by a local health department but who provide 
services without compensation for the programs and services provided by a local 
health department are, for the provision of those services, state agents of the 
Department of Health Services in certain circumstances for certain legal purposes 
and protections.  For example, under the bill, if a physician assistant or certified 
advanced practice nurse prescriber who is considered a state agent of DHS is a 
defendant in any action or special proceeding because of acts they committed within 
the scope of their agency, any judgment as to damages and costs entered against 
them shall be paid by DHS.
Further, this bill provides that physician assistants and advanced practice 
nurse prescribers may be selected by a school district or a local health department 
to supervise an immunization program and issue orders for the administration of 1

physician assistant or advanced practice nurse prescriber is not an employee of the 
school district or local health department, receives no compensation for his or her 
services as supervisor of the immunization program, and acts in accordance with 
written protocols issued by DHS, he or she is a state agent of DHS for the same 
legal purposes and protections as described above.
