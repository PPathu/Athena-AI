2025 SENATE BILL 56
February 21, 2025 - Introduced by Senators QUINN  and TOMCZYK , cosponsored by 
Representatives GREEN , ARMSTRONG , BEHNKE , MURSAU , O'C ONNOR , TUCKER  
and TUSLER . Referred to Committee on Utilities and Tourism.
AN ACT to amend  281.61 (2r) (e) of the statutes; relating to:  the use of federal 
capitalization grant funds for lead service line replacement.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, the Department of Administration and the Department of 
Natural Resources administer the safe drinking water loan program (SDWLP), 
which provides financial assistance from the environmental improvement program 
to local governmental units and to the private owners of community water systems 
that serve local governmental units for projects for the planning, designing, 
construction, or modification of public water systems. DNR establishes a funding 
list for SDWLP projects, and DOA allocates funding for those projects.
Current law specifies several allowable methods of providing financial 
assistance under the SDWLP, one of which is using funds received as federal 
capitalization grants.  There is, however, a prohibition on using those funds to 
provide principal forgiveness to a private owner of a community water system.  This 
bill provides that this prohibition does not apply to the use of federal capitalization 
grants for forgiveness of loans for the replacement of lead service lines.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:1
