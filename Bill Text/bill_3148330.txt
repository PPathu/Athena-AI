  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  77.25 (8) of the statutes; relating to:  exempting certain 
conveyances between grandparents and grandchildren from the real estate 
transfer fee.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill exempts conveyances of real estate interests between grandparent 
and grandchild for nominal consideration from the real estate transfer fee.  Subject 
to various exemptions, current law generally requires a person who conveys an 
interest in real estate to file a real estate transfer return with the county register of 
deeds and pay a real estate transfer fee equal to 30 cents for each $100 of the value 
of the conveyance.
Because this bill relates to an exemption from state or local taxes, it may be 
referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Tax Exemptions for a report to be 
printed as an appendix to the bill.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do
