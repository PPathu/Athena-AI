  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to create  66.0511 (5), 895.4465 and 947.065 of the statutes; relating 
to: civil action for injury or damages resulting from riot or vandalism, 
participation in a riot, prohibiting certain limitations or restrictions on law 
enforcement responses to riot or vandalism activity, and providing a penalty.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill makes it a Class I felony to urge, promote, organize, encourage, or 
instigate others to commit a riot and a Class H felony to intentionally commit an act 
of violence while participating in a riot.
The bill defines a XriotY as a public disturbance that involves an act of violence, 
as part of an assembly of at least three persons, that constitutes a clear and present 
danger of property damage or personal injury or a threat of an act of violence, as 
part of an assembly of at least three persons having the ability of immediate 
execution of the threat, if the threatened action constitutes a clear and present 
danger of property damage or personal injury.
The bill establishes a civil cause of action for any person who suffers injury or 
loss to person or property as a result of conduct that violates the criminal 
prohibitions on vandalism or participation in a riot.  The bill allows a person to 
bring a civil action against a person who committed the violation and against any 
person or organization that provided material support or resources with the intent 1

SECTION  1
that such support or resources would be used to perpetrate the offense.  The person 
bringing the action may obtain an order requiring the offender to fix or repair the 
damage caused to the person [s property if certain requirements set forth in the bill 
are met.
The bill also prohibits any government official with authority over any law 
enforcement agency or law enforcement officers from limiting or restricting the 
authority of the agency to have its officers, or certain officers, arrest or detain 
individuals involved in a riot or vandalism activity or take action to quell a riot or 
vandalism activity.  The bill also prohibits any government official with authority 
over any law enforcement agency from limiting or restricting the authority of law 
enforcement officers, or certain designated law enforcement officers, to arrest or 
detain individuals involved in a riot or vandalism activity or to take action to quell 
a riot or vandalism activity.  Finally, the bill provides that no government official, 
law enforcement agency, or law enforcement officer may discharge, demote, 
reassign, or take any punitive action against any employee because the employee 
made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in any 
investigation, proceeding, or hearing regarding a violation of the prohibitions on 
government officials set forth in the bill.
Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, 
the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a 
report.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
