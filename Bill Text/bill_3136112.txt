Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill requires, within 6 months of the effective date of the bill, that each 
public building in this state display the national motto, XIn God We Trust, Y in a 
location that is visible to the public if the building is open to the public, and in a 
location where notices for employees are regularly posted if it is a building that is 
not open to the public.
Beginning in the 2026-27 school year, the bill also requires that the national 
motto, XIn God We Trust, Y be displayed in each public school classroom, including 
charter school classrooms.  Under current law, each school board and governing 
body of a private school must display the U.S. flag in the schoolroom or from a 
flagstaff on the school grounds during the school hours of each school day.
Under the bill, the required displays in both public buildings and public 
schools must 1) be at least 11 inches by 14 inches, 2) be on a poster, in a framed 
document, or inscribed on a wall, and 3) be presented in English in a legible font.
