to: prostitution crime surcharge and making an appropriation.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, the court must impose certain surcharges on a defendant 
who has been found guilty of a criminal offense.  The surcharges are in addition to 
any applicable fines, costs, and fees.  For instance, the court must impose a crime 
victim and witness assistance surcharge in an amount of $67 for each conviction of 
a misdemeanor count and in an amount of $92 for each conviction of a felony count.  
The surcharge amounts collected reimburse counties for services provided to 
victims and witnesses of crimes.
This bill creates a $5,000 surcharge to be imposed on persons who are 
convicted of patronizing or soliciting prostitutes, pandering, keeping a place of 
prostitution, soliciting a child for prostitution, or patronizing a child.  Under the 
bill, the surcharge amounts collected are used for treatment and services for sex-
trafficking victims and for criminal investigative operations and law enforcement 
relating to Internet crimes against children.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.1
