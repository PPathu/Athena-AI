Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
VOTER  PREREGISTRATION  OF 16- AND 17- YEAR -OLDS
Under current law, only qualified electors may register to vote and vote in an 
election.  A qualified elector is a U.S. citizen age 18 or older who has resided in an 
election district or ward for 28 consecutive days.
Under this bill, an individual who is age 16 or 17 but who is otherwise eligible 
to vote in Wisconsin may preregister to vote.  An individual who preregisters under 
the bill may not vote in an election unless he or she is at least 18 years of age on 
election day.
VOTER  REGISTRATION  AT HIGH  SCHOOLS
Prior to 2011 Wisconsin Act 240, state law required that all public high schools 
be used for voter registration for enrolled students and members of the high school 1

staff.  Prior law also authorized voter registration to take place at a private high 
school or a tribal school that operates high school grades if requested by the 
principal.  This bill reinstates those provisions.
Under the bill, the municipal clerk must notify the school board of each school 
district in which the municipality is located that high schools will be used for voter 
registration.  The school board and the clerk then appoint at least one qualified 
voter at each high school to be a special school registration deputy.  The bill allows 
students and staff to register at the school on any day that classes are regularly 
held.  The deputies promptly forward the registration forms to the clerk and the 
clerk adds qualified voters to the registration list.  The clerk may reject a 
registration form, but the clerk must notify the registrant and inform the registrant 
of the reason for being rejected.  Under the bill, a form completed by an individual 
who will be 18 years of age before the next election and who is otherwise qualified to 
vote must be filed in such a way so that the individual is automatically registered to 
vote when the individual is 18.
Finally, the bill allows a principal of a private high school or tribal school that 
operates high school grades to request that the municipal clerk appoint a qualified 
voter at the school to be a special school registration deputy.  Under the bill, the 
clerk must appoint a special school registration deputy if the clerk determines that 
the private high school or tribal school has a substantial number of students 
residing in the municipality.
