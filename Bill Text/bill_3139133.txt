  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  943.10 (1m) (intro.) of the statutes; relating to:  entering 
certain places with intent to commit battery and providing a penalty.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, it is a Class F felony to intentionally enter a dwelling or 
certain other places without consent, that is, to commit a burglary, with intent to 
steal or commit a felony therein.  Under current law, such a burglary is a Class E 
felony if certain additional circumstances apply.  The penalty for a Class F felony is 
a fine not to exceed $25,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 12 years and six months, 
or both, and the penalty for a Class E felony is a fine not to exceed $50,000 or 
imprisonment not to exceed 15 years, or both.
Under this bill, it is also a Class F felony, or a Class E felony if certain 
additional circumstances apply, to intentionally enter a dwelling or certain other 
places without consent with intent to commit any battery.
Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, 
the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a 
report.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:1
