  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  951.18 (2m) of the statutes; relating to:  injuring or killing a 
police or fire animal and providing a penalty.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, no person may do any of the following to any animal that is 
used by a law enforcement agency or fire department to perform agency or 
department functions or duties:  frighten, intimidate, threaten, abuse, or harass 
the animal; strike, shove, kick, or otherwise subject the animal to physical contact; 
or strike the animal by using a dangerous weapon.  Under current law, any person 
who intentionally does any of those actions and causes injury to the animal is guilty 
of a Class I felony, and any person who intentionally does any of those actions and 
causes death of the animal is guilty of a Class H felony.  Additionally, for such a 
violation, a sentencing court must require a criminal violator to pay restitution, 
including veterinary care expenses or the value of a replacement animal.
This bill increases the penalty for injuring such an animal to a Class H felony 
and the penalty for causing the death of such an animal to a Class G felony.  A Class 
H felony is punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to six years, 
or both, and a Class G felony is punishable by a fine of up to $25,000 or 
imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both.
Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, 1
