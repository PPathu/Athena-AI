Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, a person who is released on extended supervision, parole, 
or probation is subject to conditions or rules of the release.  If the person violates a 
condition or rule, the person is subject to sanctions for the violation, which may 
include revocation of release.  This bill requires the Department of Corrections to 
recommend revoking a person [s extended supervision, parole, or probation if the 
person is charged with a crime while on release.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
