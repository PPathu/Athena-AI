302.114 (1), 303.065 (1) (b) 2., 304.02 (5) and 973.014 (2); to create  948.051 (1) 
(b) and 948.051 (2) (a) and (b) of the statutes; relating to:  imposing the 
penalty of life imprisonment for the crime of child trafficking and providing a 
penalty.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, a person who is convicted of the crime of trafficking a child, 
or who knowingly benefits from the crime of trafficking a child, is guilty of a Class 
C felony.  This bill increases the penalty to a Class A felony if the crime involved at 
least three victims who were children at the time the crime was committed.  A Class 
A felony carries a penalty of life imprisonment.
Under current law, the court must impose a bifurcated sentence on a person 
who is being sentenced for a felony that was committed on or after December  31, 
1999.  A bifurcated sentence is a sentence that comprises a term of confinement in 
prison followed by a term of extended supervision in the community.  Under current 
law, a court that sentences a person who has been convicted of a Class A felony 
committed on or after December 31, 1999, must determine one of the following:  1)  
the person is eligible for release to extended supervision after serving a 20-year 1

SECTION  1
term of confinement in prison; 2)  the person is eligible for release to extended 
supervision on a certain date that is after the person serves a 20-year term of 
confinement in prison; or 3)  the person is not eligible for release to extended 
supervision.  Under this bill, a person is not eligible for release to extended 
supervision if the person is convicted of a Class A felony violation of trafficking a 
child.
Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, 
the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a 
report.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.
