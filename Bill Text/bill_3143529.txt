practice in other compact states.  Significant provisions of the compact include the 
following:
1.  The creation of a Social Work Licensure Compact Commission, which 
includes one member or administrator of the licensure authorities of each member 
state.  The commission has various powers and duties granted in the compact, 
including establishing bylaws, promulgating binding rules for the compact, hiring 
officers, electing or appointing employees, and establishing and electing an 
executive committee. The commission may levy on and collect an annual 
assessment from each member state or impose fees on licensees of member states to 
cover the cost of the operations and activities of the commission and its staff.
2.  The ability for a social worker who is licensed in a home state and satisfies 
certain other criteria to obtain a multistate license, which allows a social worker to 
practice social work in all other compact states (remote states) under a multistate 
authorization to practice.  The compact specifies a number of requirements in order 
for an individual to obtain a social worker multistate license, including holding or 
being eligible for a social worker license in a home state, paying any required fees, 
and satisfying a number of criteria that are specific to the category of social work 
license the individual is seekingâ€”bachelor [s, master [s, or clinical.  A regulated 
social worker [s services in a remote state are subject to that member state [s 
regulatory authority.  A remote state may take actions against a social worker [s 
multistate authorization to practice within that remote state, and if any adverse 
action is taken by a home state against a licensee [s multistate license, the social 
worker[s multistate authorization to practice in all other member states is 
deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license.
3.  The ability of member states to issue subpoenas that are enforceable in 
other states.
4.  The creation of a coordinated data system containing licensure and 
disciplinary action information on social workers.  The compact requires all home 
state disciplinary orders that impose adverse actions against the license of a 
regulated social worker to include a statement that the regulated social worker [s 
multistate authorization to practice is deactivated in all member states until all 
conditions of the decision, order, or agreement are satisfied.  A member state must 
submit a uniform data set to the data system on all individuals to whom the 
compact is applicable as required by the rules of the commission.
5.  Provisions regarding resolutions of disputes among member states and 
between member and nonmember states, including a process for termination of a 
state[s membership in the compact if the state defaults on its obligations under the 
compact.
Since the compact has already been enacted by the minimum number of states 
required for it to become active, the compact becomes effective in this state upon 
enactment of the bill.  The compact provides that it may be amended upon 
enactment of an amendment by all member states.  A state may withdraw from the 
compact by repealing the statute authorizing the compact, but the compact provides 2025 - 2026  Legislature

SECTION  1
that a withdrawal does not take effect until 180 days after the effective date of that 
repeal.

commission [s rule-making authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate
