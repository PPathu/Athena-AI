appropriation.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill provides additional state aid to public and private schools in this 
state that provide free meals to all pupils.
Under current law, the Department of Public Instruction makes payments to 
school districts, private schools, independent charter schools, tribal schools, the 
Wisconsin Educational Services Program for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, and the 
Wisconsin Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired to partially match the federal 
contribution under the National School Lunch Program, under which schools 
provide free or reduced-price lunches to low-income children.  Currently, the state 1

share for school lunches is a variable percentage of the amount of the federal basic 
reimbursement, which is then allocated among eligible schools according to the 
number of lunches served during the prior school year.
Also under current law, DPI provides a per meal reimbursement to school 
districts, private schools, and tribal schools that provide breakfast to pupils under 
the federal School Breakfast Program.  Currently, the state provides a per meal 
reimbursement of $0.15 for each breakfast served under the program, but, if there 
is insufficient funding to pay the full amount, DPI prorates the payments.
Under the bill, a school is eligible for additional state reimbursement for 
lunches and breakfasts served in a school year if the school 1) participates in both 
the National School Lunch Program and the federal School Breakfast Program for 
the school year; and 2) for each school day in which school is in session during the 
school year, provides to any pupil who requests one, at no cost to the pupil, one 
lunch and one breakfast that meet the federal food, nutritional, and other 
requirements for meals served under the federal programs.  Under the bill, DPI 
must reimburse an eligible school a per meal amount that is equal to the federal 
reimbursement rate applicable to the eligible school under the applicable federal 
program for a meal served to a pupil who satisfies the income eligibility criteria for 
a free lunch, minus any amount the eligible school receives from the federal 
government to pay for those meals.  In other words, the bill guarantees that an 
eligible school will receive a total amount in state and federal aid that will 
reimburse the eligible school an amount equal to the free meal reimbursement rate 
for each meal the eligible school serves.
The additional state reimbursement under the bill is available to school 
districts, independent charter schools, private schools, tribal schools, residential 
care centers for children and youth, the Wisconsin Educational Services Program 
for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, and the Wisconsin Center for the Blind and 
Visually Impaired that meet the eligibility requirements.
Under the bill, if a school does not meet the eligibility requirements for the 
additional state reimbursement for a school year, all of the following apply:
1.  If the school participates in the National School Lunch Program for the 
school year, DPI will reimburse the school an amount required to meet the state [s 
matching obligation under the federal program.
2.  If the school participates in the federal School Breakfast Program for the 
school year, DPI will reimburse the school $0.15 for each breakfast served under the 
federal program, without proration.
