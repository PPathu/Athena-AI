  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  51.20 (13) (cr), 165.76 (1) (am), 938.34 (15) (a) 1., 944.30 (1m) 
(intro.), 944.30 (2m) and 973.015 (2m) (intro.) of the statutes; relating to:  
prosecuting or adjudicating delinquent a person under the age of 18 for 
committing an act of prostitution.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, a person who is under the age of 18 may be prosecuted or 
adjudicated delinquent for committing an act of prostitution, a Class A 
misdemeanor.  Under this bill, a person who is under the age of 18 may not be 
prosecuted or adjudicated delinquent for committing an act of prostitution.  This 
bill also eliminates the option under current law in cases where a person under the 
age of 18 has committed an act of prostitution for a court to enter a consent decree 
under the Juvenile Justice Code, or a deferred prosecution agreement under the 
Juvenile Justice Code or adult criminal statutes, if the court determines that a 
consent decree or deferred prosecution agreement will serve the best interests of 
the person being prosecuted and will not harm society.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:1
