AN ACT to renumber  94.64 (1) (a); to amend  94.64 (3m) (a) (intro.), 94.64 (3m) 
(a) 1., 94.64 (9) (c), 94.65 (4) (a) (intro.) and 94.65 (4) (b); to create  94.64 (1) 
(ag), 94.64 (1) (u), 94.64 (2) (f), 94.64 (3m) (a) 3., 94.65 (1) (bm), 94.65 (1) (fm) 
and 94.65 (5m) of the statutes; relating to:  the distribution and labeling of 
fertilizers and soil or plant additives produced from manure.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill makes the following changes to requirements that apply to fertilizers 
and soil or plant additives that are produced from converting manure into compost 
or vermicompost and their derivatives:
1.  The bill allows a person to distribute a fertilizer that is produced from 
converting manure into compost or vermicompost and their derivatives and that has 
a combined weight of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that is less than 24 
percent of the total weight of the fertilizer.  Current law requires a fertilizer 
distributed in this state to be guaranteed to contain a combined weight of nitrogen, 
phosphorous, and potassium that is at least 24 percent of the total weight of the 
fertilizer, unless either 1) the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer 
Protection promulgates a rule exempting the fertilizer; or 2) DATCP grants a 1

SECTION  1
permit authorizing the distribution of the fertilizer as a nonagricultural or special-
use fertilizer.
2.  The bill also exempts a fertilizer that is produced from converting manure 
into compost from being required to contain a minimum amount of certain plant 
nutrients.  Additionally, under the bill, a label, invoice, or statement accompanying 
fertilizer produced from converting manure into compost is allowed to represent the 
amount of plant nutrients or other beneficial substances contained in the fertilizer 
if the truthfulness of the representation is substantiated by a typical analysis or 
other scientifically validated analytical method.
3.  Under the bill, DATCP may not require a controlled experimental field test 
to substantiate the efficacy and usefulness of a soil or plant additive produced from 
converting manure into compost.  Under current law, DATCP may require the 
efficacy and usefulness of a soil or plant additive to be substantiated by controlled 
experimental studies using the soil or plant additive.
4.  The bill allows the truthfulness of a statement on a permit application or 
label of a soil or plant additive produced from converting manure into compost to be 
substantiated by a typical analysis.  Current law requires the label of a soil or plant 
additive to make a guarantee about the minimum amount of the substances that it 
contains.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
