2025 SENATE BILL 52
February 21, 2025 - Introduced by Senator JACQUE , cosponsored by Representatives 
KITCHENS , O'C ONNOR , SHEEHAN  and WICHGERS . Referred to Committee on 
Transportation and Local Government.
AN ACT to amend  69.20 (2) (b), 69.21 (1) (a) 2. a., 69.21 (2) (a), 69.21 (2) (b), 
69.21 (2) (d) 1. and 69.30 (3) of the statutes; relating to:  copies of and 
inspection or disclosure of information contained in certain vital records.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Current state vital records law contains provisions addressing the issuance 
and copying of and inspection or disclosure of information contained in vital records 
and in certain circumstances, distinguishes between records for events before and 
after October 1, 1907.  This bill changes the distinguishing date in those 
circumstances from the fixed date in 1907 to instead allow expanded authority to 
inspect or disclose information contained in or copy a vital record if the event that is 
the subject of the record took place at least 100 years ago.  More specifically, the 
authority to issue, copy, or allow inspection or disclosure of information contained 
in a vital record specified under current law based on whether the event that is the 
subject of the record occurred before or after October 1, 1907, would, under the bill, 
instead be triggered by whether the event took place before or on or after January 1 
of the year that is 100 years prior to the date of the request or, in the case of certain 
photocopies, the date of the issuance of the uncertified copy of the vital recordâ€”a 
date that will automatically advance as time progresses.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.1
