Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill prohibits the Department of Health Services from imposing any 
utilization management controls for prescription drugs under the Medical 
Assistance program that are approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration 
and are classified as antipsychotic.  Utilization management controls are formal 
techniques used by a health carrier or prescription drug utilization management 
entity that are designed to evaluate prescription drug medical necessity, 
appropriateness, efficacy, or efficiency.  Currently, DHS administers the Medical 
Assistance program, which is a joint federal and state program that provides health 
services to individuals who have limited financial resources.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
