  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  304.078 (3) and 973.20 (10) (a) of the statutes; relating to:  
restitution orders following a conviction for human trafficking and restoration 
of the right to vote to a person barred from voting as a result of a felony 
conviction.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, when a defendant is sentenced or placed on probation for a 
crime, the court must order the defendant to pay restitution to the victim of the 
crime to pay for costs incurred by the victim or the victim [s estate as a result of the 
crime.  The court may require that restitution be paid immediately, within a 
specified time, or in specified installments.  The court may not set the time limit to 
be later than the end of the defendant [s term of probation, parole, or extended 
supervision.  When the defendant has completed the term, any outstanding 
restitution is enforceable in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.  The 
victim may use civil court actions to collect the restitution, including seeking a 
wage garnishment or an execution against the defendant [s property (a court order 
to the sheriff to seize property, sell it, and use the money toward the outstanding 
restitution).  Under this bill, if the defendant is sentenced or placed on probation for 
human trafficking, the court must require restitution be paid immediately and, if 1

the defendant fails to pay immediately, the court must issue an execution against 
the defendant [s property.
Under current law, a person convicted of treason, felony, or bribery may not 
vote unless the person [s right to vote is restored through a pardon or through 
completion of the term of imprisonment, including parole or extended supervision, 
or probation for the crime that led to the disqualification.  Under the bill, in 
addition to completing his or her term of imprisonment or probation for the crime, a 
person must have paid all fines, costs, fees, surcharges, and restitution, and have 
completed any court-ordered community service, imposed in connection with the 
crime.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.

fees, surcharges, and restitution, and has completed any court-ordered community 
service, imposed in connection with the crime.  The department or, if the person is
