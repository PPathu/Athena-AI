  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  121.07 (6) (a) (intro.) and 121.07 (6) (am); to create  121.07 
(6) (ap) of the statutes; relating to:  excluding expenditures funded by 
referenda from shared costs for the purpose of determining equalization aid for 
school districts.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, a school district [s shared cost is one of the factors used to 
calculate a school district [s equalization aid.  Generally, under current law, a school 
district[s shared cost is the sum of the school district [s expenditures from its general 
fund and its debt service fund.
Under this bill, expenditures from either a school district [s general fund or 
debt service fund that are authorized by 1) an operating referendum held after the 
date on which this bill becomes law to exceed the school district [s revenue limit by 
more than $50,000,000 or 2) a capital referendum held after the date on which this 
bill becomes law to borrow more than $50,000,000 are excluded from the school 
district[s shared cost, unless the school district was a negative tertiary school 
district in the previous school year.  A school district is a negative tertiary school 
district if its equalized valuation exceeds the tertiary guaranteed valuation per 
member.1
