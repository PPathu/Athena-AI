2025 ASSEMBLY BILL 68
February 24, 2025 - Introduced by Representative DITTRICH , cosponsored by 
Senator TESTIN . Referred to Committee on Health, Aging and Long-Term 
Care. 
 
  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  961.385 (2) (cs) 1., 961.385 (5) (b) and 961.385 (6) (a) of the 
statutes; relating to:  the prescription drug monitoring program.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Current law requires the Controlled Substances Board to establish a 
prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) that requires pharmacies and 
health care practitioners to generate records documenting the dispensing of 
monitored prescription drugs.  Records from the PDMP may be disclosed to persons 
specified under current law or by the board by rule.  This bill makes changes to 
certain requirements under the PDMP:
1.  Subject to exceptions, current law requires that a patient [s records under 
the program be reviewed before a practitioner issues a prescription order for the 
patient.  However, current law provides that this requirement does not apply after 
April 1, 2025.  The bill extends the application of this requirement by five years, to 
April 1, 2030.
2.  Current law requires the board to conduct a quarterly review of the PDMP 
to evaluate the actual outcomes of the PDMP compared with projected outcomes. 
However, current law provides that this requirement does not apply after October 
30, 2025.  The bill extends the application of this requirement by five years, to 
October 30, 2030.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.1
