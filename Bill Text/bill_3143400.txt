SENATE BILL 71- 2 - LRB-1917/1

1.  The creation of a Dietitian Licensure Compact Commission, which includes 
the primary administrators of the licensure authorities of each member state.  The 
commission has various powers and duties granted in the compact, including 
establishing bylaws, promulgating rules for the compact, appointing officers and 
hiring employees, and establishing and electing an executive committee. The 
commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state 
or impose fees on licensees to whom it grants a compact privilege to cover the cost of 
the operations and activities of the commission and its staff.
2.  The ability for a dietitian to obtain a Xcompact privilege, Y which allows a 
dietitian to practice dietetics in another compact state (remote state) if the dietitian 
satisfies certain criteria.  The compact specifies a number of requirements in order 
for a dietitian to exercise a compact privilege, including holding an unencumbered 
dietitian license in a home state and paying any fees and meeting any jurisprudence 
requirements that may be imposed by a remote state.  A dietitian practicing in a 
remote state under a compact privilege must adhere to the laws and regulations of 
that state.  A remote state may, in accordance with that state [s laws, take adverse 
action against a licensee [s compact privilege within that state.  If a dietitian [s 
license is encumbered, the dietitian loses the compact privilege in all remote states 
until certain criteria are satisfied.  If a dietitian [s compact privilege in any remote 
state is removed, the dietitian may lose the compact privilege in all other remote 
states until certain criteria are satisfied.
3.  The ability of member states to issue subpoenas that are enforceable in 
other states.
4.  The creation of a coordinated data system containing licensure and 
disciplinary action information on dietitians.  The compact requires member states 
to report adverse actions against licensees and to monitor the data system to 
determine whether adverse actions have been taken against licensees.  A member 
state must submit a uniform data set to the data system on all individuals to whom 
the compact is applicable as required by the rules of the commission.
5.  Provisions regarding resolutions of disputes between member states and 
between member and nonmember states, including a process for termination of a 
state[s membership in the compact if the state defaults on its obligations under the 
compact.
The compact becomes effective in this state upon its enactment in seven states.  
The compact provides that it may be amended upon enactment of an amendment by 
all member states.  A state may withdraw from the compact by repealing the statute 
authorizing the compact, but the compact provides that a withdrawal does not take 
effect until 180 days after the effective date of that repeal.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:2025 - 2026  Legislature
