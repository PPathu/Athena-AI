Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
  EXPLANATION OF PROPOSAL   
 This proposed constitutional amendment, to be given second consideration by 
the 2025 legislature for submittal to the voters in November 2026, was first 
considered by the 2023 legislature in 2023 Senate Joint Resolution 54, which 
became 2023 Enrolled Joint Resolution 11.
This constitutional amendment provides that the state or a political 
subdivision of the state may not order the closure of or forbid gatherings in places of 
worship in response to a state of emergency at the national, state, or local level, 
including an emergency related to public health.
  PROCEDURE FOR SECOND CONSIDERATION   
 When a proposed constitutional amendment is before the legislature on 
second consideration, any change in the text approved by the preceding legislature 
causes the proposed constitutional amendment to revert to first consideration 
status so that second consideration approval would have to be given by the next 
legislature before the proposal may be submitted to the people for ratification [see 
joint rule 57 (2)]. 
 If the legislature approves a proposed constitutional amendment on second 1

amendment to the people for ratification and must determine the question or 
questions to appear on the ballot.
Whereas, the 2023 legislature in regular session considered a proposed 
amendment to the constitution in 2023 Senate Joint Resolution 54, which became 
2023 Enrolled Joint Resolution 11, and agreed to it by a majority of the members 
elected to each of the two houses, which proposed amendment reads as follows:
SECTION  1.  Section 18 of article I of the constitution is amended to 
read:
[Article I] Section 18.  The right of every person to worship 
Almighty God according to the dictates of conscience shall never be 
infringed; nor shall any person be compelled to attend, erect or support 
any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry, without consent; nor 
shall any control of, or interference with, the rights of conscience be 
permitted, or any preference be given by law to any religious 
establishments or modes of worship; nor shall any money be drawn from 
the treasury for the benefit of religious societies, or religious or 
theological seminaries; nor shall the state or a political subdivision of the 
state order the closure of or forbid gatherings in places of worship in 
response to a state of emergency at the national, state, or local level, 
including an emergency related to public health.
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the assembly , the senate  concurring, 
That  the foregoing proposed amendment to the constitution is agreed to by the 
2025 legislature; and, be it further 
 Resolved, That  the foregoing proposed amendment to the constitution be 
submitted to a vote of the people at the election to be held on the first Tuesday of
