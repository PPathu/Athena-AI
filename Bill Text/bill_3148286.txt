  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to create  347.495 and 347.50 (6) of the statutes; relating to:  
registration plate concealment devices and providing a penalty.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, any motor vehicle for which the Department of 
Transportation has issued registration plates must display those plates, along with 
any decals issued for the plates.
This bill prohibits the possession, sale, purchase, installation, and use of a 
registration plate concealment device, which is a manual, electronic, or mechanical 
device designed or adapted to be installed on a motor vehicle to 1) switch between 
two or more registration plates; 2) move, obstruct, or conceal a registration plate; or 
3) alter the appearance of a registration plate so that the registration number 
cannot be seen and read.  The bill also prohibits the equipment of any motor vehicle 
with a registration plate concealment device.
A person who violates these prohibitions may be fined not more than $1,000 or 
imprisoned for not more than 90 days, or both.  Any vehicle equipped in violation of 
these prohibitions may be impounded, and reasonable costs for towing and 
impounding the vehicle may be assessed against the owner.
Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, 
the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a 
report.1
