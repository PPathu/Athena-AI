AN ACT to amend  118.13 (1); to create  118.132 of the statutes; relating to:  
designating athletic sports and teams operated or sponsored by public schools 
or private schools participating in a parental choice program based on the sex 
of the participants.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill requires each school board, independent charter school, and private 
school participating in a parental choice program (educational institution) that 
operates or sponsors an interscholastic, intramural, or club athletic team or sport to 
designate the athletic team or sport based on the sex of the participating pupils.  
The bill defines XsexY as the sex determined at birth by a physician and reflected on 
the birth certificate.  The bill also requires an educational institution to prohibit a 
male pupil from 1) participating on an athletic team or in an athletic sport 
designated for females and 2) using a locker room designated for females.  Finally, 
the bill requires the educational institution to notify pupils and parents if an 
educational institution intends to change a designation for an athletic team or 
sport.1
