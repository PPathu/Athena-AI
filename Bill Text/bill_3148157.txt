  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to create  71.05 (6) (b) 57., 71.53 (2) (g) and 71.77 (9) of the statutes; 
relating to:  creating an individual income tax deduction for certain income 
earned by an individual from the practice of psychiatry or from providing 
psychiatric or mental health services.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill creates an individual income tax subtract modification, or deduction, 
for up to $100,000 or $200,000 of income earned in this state by a psychiatrist or by 
a psychiatric or mental health nurse practitioner, in the taxable year to which the 
claim relates, from the practice of psychiatry or from providing psychiatric or 
mental health services.  The maximum $200,000 deduction may be claimed by a 
psychiatrist or psychiatric or mental health nurse practitioner who practices or 
performs services in a medically underserved area, as defined under federal law, 
and the maximum $100,000 deduction may be claimed by a psychiatrist or 
psychiatric or mental health nurse practitioner who does not practice or perform 
services in such an area.  The deduction may not be claimed for more than five 
years, and must be claimed during the five-year period that begins once the 
claimant first claims the deduction.  The deduction must be claimed initially within 
the first two years that a psychiatrist or psychiatric or mental health nurse 
practitioner begins to practice in this state, or within the first two years that a 1

SECTION  1
psychiatrist or psychiatric or mental health nurse practitioner returns to this state 
after practicing in another state.  If an individual begins to claim the deduction and 
is then ineligible to claim the deduction in any year that he or she is a full-year 
resident of this state, the individual may again claim the deduction in a future year 
if eligible to do so.  If an individual begins to claim the deduction but is unable to 
claim it for five consecutive years because he or she leaves the state, the individual 
must add to his or her tax that is due for the year in which he or she leaves the state 
the total gross tax that would have been due if the subtraction was not claimed for 
any year minus the amount of gross tax actually due for those years.  In addition, an 
individual who is eligible for and claims the deduction may not claim the homestead 
tax credit.
Because this bill relates to an exemption from state or local taxes, it may be 
referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Tax Exemptions for a report to be 
printed as an appendix to the bill.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
