  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to renumber and amend  62.90 (8); to amend  79.02 (2) (b) and 79.02 
(3); to create  62.90 (8) (c), (d) and (e), 79.02 (4) and 115.437 (2) (b) 3. of the 
statutes; relating to:  the requirement that first class cities and first class city 
school districts place school resource officers in schools.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Current law requires, beginning January 1, 2024, the school board of a first 
class city school district (currently only Milwaukee Public Schools) to ensure that at 
least 25 school resource officers are present at schools within the school district 
(SRO requirement).  Under current law, a Xschool resource officer Y is a law 
enforcement officer who is deployed in community-oriented policing and assigned 
by the law enforcement agency that employs him or her  to work in a full-time 
capacity in collaboration with a school district.  Current law also requires MPS and 
the City of Milwaukee to agree on how to apportion the costs of meeting the SRO 
requirement between the two entities.
On October 8, 2024, a complaint was filed in Milwaukee County that alleged 
MPS is failing to comply with the SRO requirement and asked for a writ of 
mandamus to require compliance.  On January 23, 2025, a Milwaukee County judge 
ordered MPS to comply with the SRO requirement on or before February 17, 2025.  
On February 17, 2025, the same Milwaukee County judge gave MPS an additional 
10 days to comply with the January 23, 2025 order.1

SECTION  1
This bill requires MPS and the City of Milwaukee to apportion 75 percent of 
the costs of complying with the SRO requirement to MPS and 25 percent to the City 
of Milwaukee.  The bill further requires that by no later than 30 days after the bill 
becomes law 1) MPS and the City of Milwaukee must enter into an agreement on 
how they will implement compliance with the SRO requirement and 2) MPS and 
the City of Milwaukee must jointly certify to the Joint Committee on Finance that 
at least 25 school resource officers are present in MPS schools.
Under the bill, a similar certification process is required if the initial 
agreement between MPS and the City of Milwaukee is terminated.  First, MPS and 
the City of Milwaukee must enter into an agreement on how they will implement 
compliance with the SRO requirement within 30 days of the termination of the 
agreement.  Second, by no later than 30 days after entering into the agreement, the 
City of Milwaukee must certify to JCF that at least 25 law enforcement officers are 
trained and available to be placed in MPS schools. Lastly, by no later than 30 days 
after the certification is made to JCF, MPS must certify to JCF that at least 25 
school resource officers are present in MPS schools.
The bill also creates financial consequences for both the City of Milwaukee 
and MPS if these requirements are not met.  Specifically, the bill directs the 
Department of Administration to withhold 10 percent of the supplemental county 
and municipal aid to the City of Milwaukee if evidence is not provided of an 
agreement between the city and MPS or if the City of Milwaukee fails to certify to 
JCF, by no later than 30 days after the bill becomes law, that at least 25 school 
resource officers are present in MPS schools and, if a new agreement is entered into 
in the future, that 25 law enforcement officers are trained and available to be 
placed in MPS schools.  Similarly, the bill requires the Department of Public 
Instruction to withhold 20 percent of the per pupil categorical aid payment owed to 
MPS if evidence is not provided of an agreement between the City of Milwaukee and 
MPS or if MPS fails to certify to JCF by no later than 30 days after the bill becomes 
law and, if required in the future due to a new agreement, that at least 25 school 
resource officers are present in MPS schools.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.
