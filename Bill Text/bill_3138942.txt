  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  77.54 (30) (a) 2. of the statutes; relating to:  the sales and 
use tax exemption for electricity and natural gas sold for residential use.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, electricity and natural gas sold during the months of 
November, December, January, February, March, and April for residential use is 
exempt from the sales and use tax.  This bill exempts from the sales and use tax 
electricity and natural gas sold for residential use regardless of when it is sold.
Because this bill relates to an exemption from state or local taxes, it may be 
referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Tax Exemptions for a report to be 
printed as an appendix to the bill.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
SECTION  1.  77.54 (30) (a) 2. of the statutes is amended to read:
77.54 (30) (a) 2.  Electricity and natural gas sold during the months of 
November, December, January, February, March and April for residential use.1
