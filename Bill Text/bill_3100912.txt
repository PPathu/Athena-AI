Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill requires a school board to comply with a school district resident [s 
written request to inspect a textbook, curriculum, or instructional material within 
14 days.
Under the bill, a school board must comply with a school district resident [s 
written request to inspect curricula or instructional materials used in a school in 
the school district by no later than 14 days after the school board receives the 
written request.  The bill also requires each school board to adopt procedures under 
which the school board is able to produce for inspection any curriculum or 
instructional material used in a school in the school district in fewer than 14 days.  
The bill defines Xcurriculum Y as a curriculum plan adopted by a school board to 
comply with state law and defines Xinstructional material Y as any course content or 
resource included in a curriculum.

textbooks by no later than 14 days after the school board receives the written 
request.  Under the bill, a school board must also adopt procedures under which the 
school board is capable of producing for inspection any textbook included on the 
school board [s list of adopted textbooks in no more than 14 days.  Current law 
requires each school board to adopt all textbooks necessary for use in schools in the 
school district and file a list of adopted textbooks with the school district clerk.  
Under the bill, each school board must also post the list of adopted textbooks on the 
school board [s website.
Finally, the bill specifies that nothing in the bill may be construed to require a 
school board to take an action that would violate federal copyright law and that the 
bill does not limit any rights a school district resident has to inspect or copy records 
under open records law.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
SECTION  1.  118.03 (1) of the statutes is amended to read:
118.03 (1)  The school board shall adopt all the textbooks necessary for use in
