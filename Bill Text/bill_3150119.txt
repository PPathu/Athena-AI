Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill is explained in the N OTES  provided by the Joint Legislative Council in 
the bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
JOINT  LEGISLATIVE  COUNCIL  PREFATORY  NOTE :  This bill was prepared for the 
Joint Legislative Council [s Special Committee on State-Tribal Relations.
Under current law, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction must conduct 
a statewide, biennial assessment of the need for American Indian language and culture 
education programs. Various information must be included in this assessment, 
including information on the numbers, ages, location, and tribal affiliation of American 
Indian pupils. While certain school districts began voluntarily reporting tribal 
affiliation data to the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) during the 2021-2022 
academic school year, current law does not explicitly require school districts to collect 
this information and report it to DPI.1

SECTION  1
Current law also requires each school district to submit an annual school district 
report to DPI. This report must include various information related to the school 
district, including the number of children taught in the schools of the school district, the 
number of hours of direct pupil instruction provided in each school of the school district, 
and the names of all teachers employed by the school district during the school year. The 
bill expands the requirements of this report, requiring each school district to report the 
numbers, ages, and tribal affiliation of American Indian children attending the schools 
of the school district.  The requirement that a school district report information relating 
to American Indian children attending the schools of the school district does not apply 
until the 2026-2027 school year.
SECTION  1.  120.18 (1) (cm) of the statutes is created to read:
120.18 (1) (cm)  Beginning with the annual report filed for the 2026-27 school 
year, the numbers, ages, and tribal affiliation of American Indian children 
attending the schools of the school district during the school year.  In this 
paragraph, XAmerican Indian Y has the meaning given in s. 115.71 (2).
