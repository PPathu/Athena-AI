February 12, 2025 - Introduced by Senator LEMAHIEU , cosponsored by 
Representative PETERSEN . Referred to Committee on Utilities and Tourism. 
 
  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to repeal  196.485 (1) (cr), 196.485 (1) (ef) and 196.485 (3g); to create  
196.485 (1) (cr), 196.485 (1) (ef) and 196.485 (3g) of the statutes; relating to:  
an incumbent transmission facility owner [s right to construct, own, and 
maintain certain transmission facilities and Public Service Commission 
procedures if the transmission facility is a regionally cost-shared transmission 
line.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill grants to an incumbent transmission facility owner the right to 
construct, own, and maintain a transmission facility that has been approved for 
construction in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator [s (MISO) 
transmission plan and that connects to transmission facilities owned by that 
incumbent transmission facility owner.  Under the bill, an Xincumbent 
transmission facility owner Y includes a transmission company or transmission 
utility (a cooperative or public utility that owns a transmission facility and provides 
transmission service in this state), regardless of whether this state is its principal 
place of business or where it is organized or headquartered.  Under current law, 
MISO is an organization that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy 1

Regulatory Commission and that coordinates and controls electric transmission in 
a region of the country that includes this state.  The bill provides that the right to 
construct, own, and maintain a transmission facility that connects to transmission 
facilities owned by two or more incumbent transmission facility owners belongs 
individually and proportionally to each incumbent transmission facility owner, 
unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.
Under the bill, if under MISO [s transmission plan a regionally cost-shared 
transmission line has been approved for construction and connection to facilities 
owned by an incumbent transmission facility owner, the incumbent transmission 
facility owner must give the Public Service Commission written notice regarding 
the owner [s intent to construct, own, and maintain the line no later than 90 days 
after approval of the transmission plan or 90 days after the date on which this bill 
becomes law, whichever is later.  If the owner indicates that it does not intent to 
construct the line, the bill requires it to fully explain that decision in the notice to 
PSC.  In that case, the bill allows PSC to determine whether the incumbent 
transmission facility owner or another entity must construct the line, taking into 
consideration issues such as cost, efficiency, and reliability.  The bill defines 
Xregionally cost-shared transmission line Y to mean a high-voltage transmission line 
that is eligible for regional cost sharing and is not subject to a right of first refusal in 
accordance with the MISO tariff.
The bill requires an incumbent transmission facility owner with the right to 
construct a MISO-approved regionally cost-shared transmission line to include in 
any application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity an estimate of 
the cost of construction, along with documentation that the estimate is the result of 
competitively bid engineering, procurement, and construction contracts.  The bill 
also requires such an incumbent transmission facility owner to provide to PSC until 
construction is complete quarterly reports that include updated estimates of the 
construction cost and an explanation of any changes from prior cost estimates.
The bill requires an incumbent transmission facility owner with the right to 
construct a MISO-approved regionally cost-shared transmission line to, as soon as 
practicable after the information is available, submit a report to PSC, the assembly 
speaker, the assembly minority leader, the senate majority leader, the senate 
minority leader, and the governor detailing the amount of the costs of the 
transmission line project that are being charged to energy consumers outside this 
state.
The bill sunsets the rights and responsibilities created under the bill after 10 
years.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
