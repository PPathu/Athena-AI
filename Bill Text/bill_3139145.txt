  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  121.91 (3) (a) 1., 121.91 (3) (c) and 121.91 (7) of the statutes; 
relating to:  school district operating referenda.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill eliminates recurring operating referenda and limits a nonrecurring 
operating referendum to no more than four years.
Current law generally limits the total amount of revenue a school district may 
receive from general school aids and property taxes in a school year. However, there 
are several exceptions to the revenue limit.  One exception is for excess revenue 
approved by referendum for recurring and nonrecurring purposes.  This type of 
referendum is often referred to as an operating referendum.  If the operating 
referendum is for a nonrecurring purpose, a school district [s authority to raise 
excess revenue is approved only for specific school years.  If the operating 
referendum is for a recurring purpose, the school district [s authority to raise excess 
revenue is permanent.  Under the bill, an operating referendum to exceed a school 
district[s revenue limit may be only for nonrecurring purposes and the referendum 
may not apply to more than four years.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:1
