  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to amend  27.01 (9) (bn) (title); to create  27.01 (9) (bg) of the statutes; 
relating to:  fee waivers for state park vehicle admission receipts to pupils 
with Every Kid Outdoors passes.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, no person may operate a vehicle in any state park or in 
certain other recreational areas on state land unless the vehicle displays a vehicle 
admission receipt.  This bill requires the Department of Natural Resources to waive 
the fee for an annual vehicle admission receipt issued to the parent or guardian of a 
child who possesses a valid Every Kid Outdoors pass issued by the U.S. National 
Park Service.  Under current federal law, such a pass authorizes free admission to 
national parks for any 4th grader and his or her family.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
SECTION  1.  27.01 (9) (bg) of the statutes is created to read:1
