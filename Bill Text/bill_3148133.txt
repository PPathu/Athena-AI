Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill requires the Department of Health Services to establish a program to 
award grants to persons in this state for research into spinal cord injuries.  The 
grants must support research into new and innovative treatments and 
rehabilitative efforts for the functional improvement of individuals with spinal cord 
injuries.  Research topics may include pharmaceutical, medical device, brain 
stimulus, and rehabilitative approaches and techniques.  DHS must make annual 
reports to the legislature about the grants.  The bill specifies that no more than 8 
percent of any grant award may be used for administrative or indirect costs and 
expenses.
The bill also requires DHS to appoint a Spinal Cord Injury Council with one 
member representing the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public 
Health who is a researcher specializing in spinal cord injuries, one member 
representing Marquette University who is a researcher specializing in spinal cord 
injuries, one member representing the Medical College of Wisconsin who is an 
expert in spinal cord injuries, and the following members: 1) a person with a spinal 
cord injury; 2) a family member of a person with a spinal cord injury; 3) a veteran 1

with a spinal cord injury; 4) a physician specializing in the treatment of spinal cord 
injuries; 5) a neurosurgery researcher; and 6) a researcher employed by the federal 
Veterans Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  If 
DHS is unable to appoint any of the foregoing members, the bill allows DHS to 
appoint, in lieu of that member, a member representing the general public.  
Members of the council have two-year terms.  The bill requires the council to 
develop criteria for DHS to evaluate and award grants, review and make 
recommendations on grant applications, and perform other duties specified by 
DHS.  Council members must make written disclosures of financial interests in 
organizations that the council recommends for grants.
Finally, the bill allows DHS, with the permission of the council, to hold 
symposia, not more than once every two years, for grant recipients to present 
findings of research supported by the grants.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
