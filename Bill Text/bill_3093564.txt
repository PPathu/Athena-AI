  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to renumber and amend  115.385 (1) (b); to amend  115.385 (1) (c); to 
create  115.385 (1) (b) 2m. and 118.30 (1j) of the statutes; relating to:  changes 
to the educational assessment program and the school and school district 
accountability report.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, the Department of Public Instruction is required to 
annually publish a school and school district accountability report, commonly 
known as school and school district report cards, for the previous school year.  To 
measure school performance and school district improvement for purposes of the 
report cards, particularly measures related to pupil achievement in reading and 
math, DPI uses data derived from pupil performance on assessments administered 
in the previous school year, including assessments commonly referred to as the 
Wisconsin Student Assessment System, which includes the Wisconsin Forward 
Exam, PreACT, the ACT with Writing, and Dynamic Learning Maps.
Under the bill, beginning with report cards published for the school year in 
which the bill becomes law, for the index system to identify school and school 
district performance and improvement, also known as the accountability rating 
categories, DPI must use the same cut scores, score ranges, and corresponding 
qualitative descriptions that DPI used for report cards published in the 2019-20 2025 - 2026  Legislature

school year.  In addition, beginning with the WSAS administered in the school year 
in which the bill becomes law, DPI must do the following:
1.  For the Wisconsin Forward exam in English Language Arts and 
Mathematics, align cut scores, score ranges, and pupil performance categories to 
the cut scores, score ranges, and pupil performance categories set by the National 
Assessment of Educational Progress.
2.  For the PreACT and ACT with Writing in English, Reading, and 
Mathematics, use the same cut scores, score ranges, and pupil performance 
categories that DPI used for the same assessments administered in the 2021-22 
school year.  The bill specifically requires DPI to use the terms “below basic,” 
“basic,” “proficient,” and “advanced” for pupil performance categories on these 
assessments.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
