  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to repeal  71.54 (1) (g) 5. and 71.54 (1) (g) 7.; to amend  71.54 (1) (g) 
(intro.), 71.54 (1) (g) 4., 71.54 (1) (g) 6. (intro.), 71.54 (2) (b) 4. and 71.54 (2m); 
to create  71.54 (1) (h) and 71.54 (2) (b) 5. of the statutes; relating to:  
expanding the homestead income tax credit.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, the homestead tax credit is a refundable income tax credit 
that may be claimed by homeowners and renters.  The credit is based on the 
claimant [s household income and the amount of property taxes or rent constituting 
property taxes on his or her Wisconsin homestead.  Because the credit is 
refundable, if the credit exceeds the claimant [s income tax liability, he or she 
receives the excess as a refund check.  Under current law, there are three key dollar 
amounts used when calculating the credit:
1.  If household income is $8,060 or less, the credit is 80 percent of the property 
taxes or rent constituting property taxes.  If household income exceeds $8,060, the 
property taxes or rent constituting property taxes are reduced by 8.785 percent of 
the household income exceeding $8,060, and the credit is 80 percent of the reduced 
property taxes or rent constituting property taxes.
2.  The credit may not be claimed if household income exceeds $24,680.1

3.  The maximum property taxes or rent constituting property taxes used to 
calculate the credit is $1,460.
Beginning with claims filed for the 2025 tax year, this bill reduces the 
percentage used for household income over $8,060 from 8.785 to 5.614 percent and 
increases the maximum income amount from $24,680 to $35,000.  The bill also 
indexes the $8,060, $35,000, and $1,460 amounts for inflation during future tax 
years.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
