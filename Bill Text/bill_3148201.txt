  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to create  943.20 (5), 943.50 (6), 971.19 (2m) and 971.36 (5) of the 
statutes; relating to:  theft crimes and providing a penalty.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, the penalty for the crime of property theft varies by the 
value of the property taken. The penalty ranges from a Class A misdemeanor if the 
value of the property is not more than $2,500 to a Class F felony if the value of the 
property exceeds $100,000. Similarly, the penalty for the crime of retail theft varies 
by the value of the merchandise or service that is taken.  The penalty ranges from a 
Class A misdemeanor if the value is not more than $500 to a Class G felony if the 
value exceeds $10,000.
This bill specifies that, if, in a six-month period, a defendant commits more 
than one violation of property theft or more than one violation of retail theft, the 
value of items taken at each violation may be aggregated and the crimes may be 
prosecuted as one property theft crime or one retail theft crime.  The penalty for the 
crime would be determined by the aggregated value of the items taken.
Because this bill creates a new crime or revises a penalty for an existing crime, 
the Joint Review Committee on Criminal Penalties may be requested to prepare a 
report.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.1
