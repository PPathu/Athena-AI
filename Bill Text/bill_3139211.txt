AN ACT to renumber and amend  67.05 (3) (d); to amend  38.16 (3) (br) 3., 
66.0602 (4) (c) and 121.91 (3) (c); to create  67.05 (3) (d) 3., 4. and 5. of the

property taxes.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, a county, city, village, town, school district, or technical 
college district may exceed its property tax levy limit if the electors of that political 
subdivision or district approve the increase at a referendum. The ballot question 
must indicate the dollar amount of the increase in the levy limit. Under this bill, the 
ballot question must also provide a good faith estimate of the annual dollar amount 
difference in property taxes on a median-valued, single-family residence located in 
the political subdivision or district that would result from passage of the 
referendum.
Also under current law, in certain cases when local governmental units 
authorize the issuance of bonds, the local governmental unit must adopt a 
resolution stating the purpose of the bonding and the maximum amounts of 
borrowing.  The local governmental unit, in certain cases, is required or authorized 
to seek approval of the bonding authorization at a referendum.  Among other 
things, the referendum question must contain a statement of the purpose for which 1
