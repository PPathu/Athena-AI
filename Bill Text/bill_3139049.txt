Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill provides that when certain governmental parties are parties to or 
intervene in an action filed in a county in which there is a first or second class city, 
any party to the action may seek to have the clerk of the circuit court in which the 
case has been filed assign venue at random.  Under the bill, a governmental party 
means 1) the legislature, either house of the legislature, or a committee of the 
legislature or of either house of the legislature, or any member of the legislature 
acting in his or her official capacity; 2) the elections commission or the ethics 
commission, or any commissioner thereof, acting in his or her official capacity; or 3) 
if acting in his or her official capacity, the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary 
of state, state treasurer, attorney general, or superintendent of public instruction, a 
secretary or deputy secretary of a department, a commissioner or deputy 
commissioner of an independent agency, the president or vice president of the 
United States, or any U.S. senator or representative in Congress from this state.
The bill provides that if an action is filed in a county in which there is a first or 
second class city and a governmental party is a party to the action, including as an 
intervenor, any party to the action has the option to elect random venue 1

assignment.  A plaintiff seeking to exercise the option for random venue assignment 
must file a notice not later than five days after the summons and complaint are 
filed.  If the party seeking to exercise the option for random venue assignment is not 
the plaintiff, that party must file notice not later than five days after the service of 
a summons and complaint upon that party.  In an action in which a governmental 
party files a motion to intervene, the notice must be filed not later than five days 
after that governmental party [s motion to intervene is granted.
Under the bill, upon receipt of a notice from a party seeking random venue 
assignment, the clerk of the circuit court in which the case is filed must select a 
circuit at random, excluding the circuit in which the case was originally filed, and 
then assign the selected circuit as the venue for the case.  The clerk of courts for the 
county where the action was initially filed must notify the clerk of courts for the 
county where the action is assigned of the venue assignment.  The court to which 
the action is assigned must then issue an order to notify the parties of the venue 
assignment.  If a case is assigned under the provisions of the bill, no party may seek 
to exercise the random venue assignment option again in the case, and neither a 
court, acting on its own, nor any party or intervenor may move for any subsequent 
change of venue.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
