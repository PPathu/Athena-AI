AN ACT to amend  349.115 (1) and 349.115 (3); to create  349.115 (1m) of the 
statutes; relating to:  impoundment of vehicles used in certain reckless 
driving offenses.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, a political subdivision may enact an ordinance authorizing 
law enforcement officers to impound vehicles used in reckless driving offenses if the 
person cited for reckless driving is the owner of the vehicle and the person has a 
prior reckless driving conviction for which a forfeiture was imposed that has not 
been fully paid.  Under this bill, such an ordinance may authorize the impoundment 
of any vehicle used in a reckless driving offense regardless of ownership of the 
vehicle or prior record of the operator.  The bill also provides that a local ordinance 
may authorize impounding such a vehicle until outstanding fines and forfeitures 
owed by the vehicle [s owner are fully paid.
Also under the bill, upon impounding a vehicle under such an ordinance, the 
law enforcement officer must attempt to determine if the vehicle has been reported 
as stolen, and if so, the officer or the impounding political subdivision must attempt 
to contact the owner.  If the vehicle is reported as stolen, the vehicle must be 
released to the owner without the payment of a fee or charge.1
