Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Under current law, a district attorney has the discretion as to whether or not 
to issue a complaint to charge a person with a crime.  Current law also provides 
that, if a district attorney refuses to issue a complaint against a person, a judge may 
conduct a hearing to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the person 
committed a crime and, if so, issue a complaint.
Under this bill, when there is an officer-involved death, which is a death that 
results directly from an action or an omission of a law enforcement officer, and the 
district attorney determined there was no basis to prosecute the officer, a court may 
not issue a complaint against the involved officer unless there is new or unused 
evidence presented.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
SECTION  1.  968.02 (3) of the statutes is renumbered 968.02 (3) (a).1
