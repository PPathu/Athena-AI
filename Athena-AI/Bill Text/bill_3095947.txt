exploitation, commercial sex acts, or labor exploitation; and
Whereas, human traffickers disproportionately target at-risk populations, 
including individuals who have experienced or been exposed to other violence, such 
as child abuse and maltreatment and community violence, and those who are 
disconnected from support networks, such as runaway and homeless youth, 
unaccompanied minors, and persons displaced by natural disasters; and
Whereas, since 2007, more than 100,000 total cases of human trafficking have 
been reported to the National Human Trafficking Hotline; and

to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children were likely child sex

reported a growing trend of traffickers targeting individuals with disabilities and

human trafficking; and
Whereas, human trafficking has been reported in all 72 counties in this state, 
and it is a crime found in rural, urban, and suburban communities; and
Whereas, human trafficking is modern-day slavery, a practice that is in direct 
opposition to the fundamental principles of liberty and human rights upon which 
our nation was founded; and
Whereas, many nonprofit organizations are working to raise awareness and 
combat human trafficking while collaborating with law enforcement to provide 
critical resources to victims, including safe housing, health care, counseling, job 
training, rehabilitation, clothing, personal care items, and hope; and
Whereas, to combat human trafficking in our state, our citizens must be aware 
of the realities of human trafficking, educated to recognize victims of human 
trafficking, and dedicated to stopping it; and
Whereas, a resolution passed by the U.S. Senate on June 22, 2007, has forever 
marked January 11 as a day of awareness and vigilance for the countless victims 
and survivors of human trafficking around the world; and
Whereas, Wisconsin has zero tolerance for human trafficking, and eliminating 2025 - 2026  Legislature - 3 - LRB-1355/1
