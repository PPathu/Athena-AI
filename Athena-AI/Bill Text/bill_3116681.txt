Department of Public Instruction to reduce the school district [s state aid payments 
by the difference between what the school board spent on direct classroom 
expenditures and the minimum that it should have spent on direct classroom 
expenditures and prohibits the school board from levying additional property taxes 
to compensate for the reduction.  Finally, if the total reduction in state aid and other 
state payments does not cover a school board [s excess expenditures, DPI must order 
the school board to reduce the property tax obligations of its taxpayers, including 
providing refunds to taxpayers who have already paid their annual taxes, by an 
amount that represents the amount of excess expenditures that have not been 
recovered through the state aid reductions.
LIMITATION  ON ANNUAL  COMPENSATION  INCREASES  FOR SCHOOL  
ADMINISTRATORS
The bill limits the amount a school board may increase the total compensation 
paid to a school district administrator, business manager, or school principal, or an 
assistant to any of those positions (collectively, school administrators), to the 
average annual percentage increase in total compensation that the school board 
provided to teachers in the school district.
Under current law, the term of a school administrator contract is limited to no 
more than two years but may provide for additional one year extensions.  The pay 
increase limitation created in the bill first applies to contracts entered into, 
renewed, or modified on the date the bill becomes law. 
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do
