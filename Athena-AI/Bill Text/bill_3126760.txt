Whereas, numerous studies and surveys demonstrate that the majority of 
Americans support nuclear energy and that support is continuing to grow for 
reasons such as: concerns over energy independence and the environment as well as 
promising technological advances in the nuclear industry; and
Whereas, today [s growing energy demands coupled with the revolutionary 
advancements in nuclear power and fusion energy technology have created an 
environment where Wisconsin must be poised to facilitate nuclear power and fusion 
energy development and expansion; now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the assembly , the senate  concurring, That the Wisconsin 
State Legislature supports nuclear power and fusion energy as clean energy 
sources that are critical to safely meeting Wisconsin [s growing energy demands;
