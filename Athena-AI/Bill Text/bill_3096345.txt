  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
Relating to:  observing February 28, 2025, as Rare Disease Day in Wisconsin.
Whereas, there are nearly 10,000 diseases and conditions considered rare 
(each affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans) in the United States, according to 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH); and
Whereas, while each of these diseases may affect small numbers of people, 
rare diseases as a group affect approximately 25 to 30 million Americans; and
Whereas, many rare diseases are serious and debilitating conditions that have 
a significant impact on the lives of those affected; and
Whereas, while more than 800 drugs and biologics have been approved for the 
treatment of rare diseases according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
millions of Americans still have rare diseases for which there is no approved 
treatment; and
Whereas, individuals and families affected by rare diseases often experience 2025 - 2026  Legislature - 2 - LRB-1368/1

problems such as diagnosis delay, difficulty finding a medical expert, and lack of 
access to treatments or ancillary services; and
Whereas, while the public is familiar with some rare diseases, many patients 
and families affected by less widely known rare diseases bear a large share of the 
burden of funding research and raising public awareness to support the search for 
treatments; and
Whereas, residents of Wisconsin are among those affected by rare diseases 
because nearly one in 10 Americans have rare diseases; and
Whereas, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) is organizing 
a nationwide observance of Rare Disease Day on February 28, 2025; now, therefore, 
be it
Resolved by the assembly , That February 28, 2025, will be observed as Rare 
Disease Day in Wisconsin.
