  ***AUTHORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE***
AN ACT to repeal  20.455 (2) (fc); to create  20.455 (2) (fc) of the statutes; 
relating to:  school safety grants and making an appropriation.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill requires the Office of School Safety in the Department of Justice to 
establish a competitive grant program that is open to public and private schools for 
grants to improve the safety of school buildings and to provide security training to 
school personnel.  In administering the program, the Office of School Safety must 
give preference to applicants that have not yet received a school safety grant from 
DOJ.  The bill provides $30,000,000 for these grants and specifies that the 
maximum amount DOJ may award to an applicant is $20,000.  The bill also 
requires the Office of School Safety to submit an annual report related to these 
grants to the Joint Committee on Finance.  Finally, the grant program sunsets on 
July 1, 2027.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do
