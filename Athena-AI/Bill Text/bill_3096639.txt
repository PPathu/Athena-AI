Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
Beginning in the 2027-28 school year, this bill requires school boards, 
independent charter schools, and private schools participating in a parental choice 
program to include in their respective curricula instruction in civics that includes 
the following topics and pupil development goals:
1.  An understanding of pupils’ shared rights and responsibilities as residents 
of this state and the United States and of the founding principles of the United 
States.
2.  A sense of civic pride and desire to participate regularly with government at 
the local, state, and federal levels.
3.  An understanding of the process for effectively advocating before 
governmental bodies and officials.
4.  An understanding of the civic-minded expectations of an upright and 2025 - 2026  Legislature

desirable citizenry that recognizes and accepts responsibility for preserving and 
defending the benefits of liberty inherited from previous generations and secured 
by the U.S. Constitution.
5.  Knowledge of other nations’ governing philosophies, including communism, 
socialism, and totalitarianism, and an understanding of how those philosophies 
compare with the philosophy and principles of freedom and representative 
democracy essential to the founding principles of the United States.
The bill also requires school boards, independent charter schools, and private 
schools participating in a parental choice program to annually report to the 
Department of Public Instruction regarding how they are meeting the civics 
instruction requirement created under the bill. DPI must then compile the 
information and submit it to the legislature.
Finally, under current law, a school board may grant a high school diploma to 
a pupil only if the pupil meets specific statutory requirements, including earning a 
certain number of credits in various subjects in the high school grades and passing 
a civics test comprised of questions that are identical to those that are asked as part 
of the process of applying for U.S. citizenship.  Currently, a pupil must earn at least 
three credits of social studies, including state and local government. The bill 
specifies that the social studies credits also must include one-half credit of civics 
instruction.  This graduation requirement first applies to pupils who graduate in 
the 2030-31 school year.
For further information see the state and local fiscal estimate, which will be 
printed as an appendix to this bill.
