support of the United States during the Vietnam War.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill expands the definition of “veteran” to include individuals who were 
naturalized pursuant to the Hmong Veterans’ Naturalization Act of 2000.  The bill 
extends most veterans benefits to anyone who meets this newly expanded definition 
of veteran, however, admission to a state veterans home and burial in a veterans 
cemetery are not included benefits as they are subject to federal regulation.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
SECTION  1.  36.27 (2) (b) 5. of the statutes is created to read:
