Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill creates tax incentives related to businesses in this state converting to 
an employee ownership business structure and requires the Department of 
Revenue to establish an outreach and education program to promote employee 
ownership business structures.
Employee ownership conversion costs tax credit
Under the bill, DOR may certify a business to claim a nonrefundable income 
tax credit for an amount equal to 70 percent of costs related to converting the 
business to a worker-owned cooperative or 50 percent of the costs related to 1

converting the business to an employee stock ownership plan.  The credit is limited 
to a maximum amount of $100,000.  A business is qualified to receive the credit if 
the business is subject to income and franchise taxes in this state and, at the time 
the business receives the credit, does not have an employee stock ownership plan 
and is not, in whole or in part, a worker-owned cooperative.
Capital gain deduction
The bill also creates an individual income tax subtraction and a corporate 
income and franchise tax deduction for the amount of the capital gain realized from 
the transfer of ownership of a business in this state to an employee stock ownership 
plan or worker-owned cooperative.
Employee ownership outreach and education
Finally, the bill directs DOR to establish an economic development program 
for the purpose of promoting employee ownership business structures, including the 
business structures of employee stock ownership plans and worker-owned 
cooperatives, through education, outreach, technical assistance, and training 
related to converting existing businesses to an employee ownership business 
structure or starting new businesses with an employee ownership business 
structure.  The bill directs DOR to submit an application to the U.S. secretary of 
labor for a grant under 29 USC 3228 for use in administering the program created 
in the bill.
Because this bill relates to an exemption from state or local taxes, it may be 
referred to the Joint Survey Committee on Tax Exemptions for a report to be 
printed as an appendix to the bill.
For further information see the state fiscal estimate, which will be printed as 
an appendix to this bill.
