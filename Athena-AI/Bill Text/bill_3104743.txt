AN ACT to create  146.78 and 600.01 (1) (b) 13. of the statutes; relating to:  
agreements for direct primary care.
Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau
This bill exempts valid direct primary care agreements from the application of 
insurance law.  A Xdirect primary care agreement, Y as defined in the bill, is a 
contract between a health care provider that provides primary care services under 
the provider [s scope of practice and an individual patient or the patient [s legal 
representative or employer in which the health care provider agrees to provide 
primary care services to the patient for an agreed-upon subscription fee and period 
of time.
A valid direct primary care agreement is in writing and satisfies all of the 
following:
1.  It is signed by the health care provider or an agent of the health care 
provider and the individual patient, the patient [s legal representative, or a 
representative of the patient [s employer.
2.  It allows either party to terminate the agreement upon written notice.
3.  It describes and quantifies the specific primary care services that are 
provided under the agreement.
4.  It specifies the subscription fee for the agreement and specifies terms for 
termination of the agreement.
5.  It specifies the duration of the agreement.1

6.  It prohibits the provider and patient from billing an insurer or any other 
third party on a fee-for-service basis for the primary care services included in the 
subscription fee under the agreement.
7.  It prominently states, in writing, several provisions, including that the 
agreement is not health insurance and the agreement alone may not satisfy 
individual or employer insurance coverage requirements under federal law; that the 
patient is responsible for paying, or directing the patient [s employer to pay, the 
provider for all services that are not included in the subscription fee under the 
agreement; that the patient is encouraged to consult with a health insurance 
advisor, the patient [s health insurance carrier, or the patient [s employer-sponsored 
health plan, as applicable, before entering into the agreement; and that direct 
primary care fees might not be credited toward deductibles or out-of-pocket 
maximum amounts under any health insurance the patient has.
Under the bill, a health care provider may not decline to enter into or 
terminate a direct primary care agreement with a patient solely because of the 
patient[s health status.  The bill allows a health care provider to decline to accept a 
patient for a direct primary care agreement only if the health care provider [s 
practice has reached its maximum patient capacity or if the patient [s medical 
condition is such that the health care provider is unable to provide the appropriate 
level and type of primary care services the patient requires.  The bill also provides 
that a health care provider may not decline to enter into a direct primary care 
agreement with a patient, terminate a direct primary care agreement with a 
patient, or otherwise discriminate against a patient in the provision of health care 
services under a direct primary care agreement on the basis of race, color, national 
origin, religious belief or affiliation, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, or 
gender identity.  A health care provider may terminate a direct primary care 
agreement with a patient only if the patient or the patient [s employer fails to pay 
the subscription fee, the patient fails repeatedly to adhere to the treatment plan, 
the patient has performed an act of fraud related to the direct primary care 
agreement, the patient is abusive in a manner described in the bill, the health care 
provider discontinues operation as a direct primary care provider, or the health 
care provider believes that the relationship is no longer therapeutic for the patient 
due to a dysfunctional relationship between the provider and the patient.
The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do 
enact as follows:
