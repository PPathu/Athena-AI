To use the web scrapper run the gettingData.py file.  In the main you can adjust which function to call. 
Running ensure_directories() & getMasterList() together will scrape the data and put it into the json file and txt files.
Running emptyBillTextFolder() will remove all pdf and txt files that are in the Bill Text folder.
